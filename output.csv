Namaskar. Acharya Shankar, Sanskriti Kaitanya's department of culture, Madhya Pradesh government cordially welcomes each Atman present in this Upanishad Sabhagar of Ekatmadham Shiver at the historic celebration called Mahakumbh, the biggest human congregation on this planet. Under which we have witnessed enlightening talks of various spiritual luminaries before. And today, we have gathered here for an equally unforgettable discourse under the Advaita for future series. I welcome all the esteemed guests which are present, with us, and I welcome all of you.

Advaita for future series, under these series of talks, we'll witness Advaita for environment today. Our planet faces urgent environmental challenges, including climate change, deforestation, extinction of species, pollution, and resource depletion. These crises are largely a result of an exploitative mindset that views nature as a resource separate from us. This disconnect has led to widespread, degradation. A new perspective is urgently required, one that fosters unity rather than division between humanity, mankind, and mother nature.

Advaita or non dualism teaches that all of existence is one. It rejects the illusion of separateness between self and the universe and the cosmos. Emphasizing that the individual and nature are interconnected, this philosophy views nature not as an external entity to be exploited and used, but as an extension of our own selves. The boundaries between us and them, human beings and the environment disappear revealing a profound oneness of both these elements. This panel today will explore how Advaita provides a transformative lens to address environmental issues by recognizing the oneness between humanity and nature.

Advaita challenges the prevailing attitude of dominance over nature. Advaita proposes that true well-being can only be achieved when we see the health of the planet as the health of our own body. This panel will examine both the spiritual and the practical aspects of exploring how this ancient wisdom of Advaita can guide modern environmental solutions. Ultimately Advaita Vedanta provides a path to living harmoniously with the Earth rooted in the understanding that we are nature itself. Thank you so much for, joining us To officially start this discussion, I would first request, doctor Manish Pandey, who's the chief executive officer of Acharya Shankar Sanskratike Tanya's department of culture to kindly come forward and felicitate all our esteemed, esteemed panel here.

The esteemed panel that we have in front of us today consists of our guest of honor, she Eric Suhemji who happens to be the ambassador of Ekatnadham initiative our guide and mentor and our moderator for the evening Swami Mitranan Saraswati ji and our very esteemed adviser in this journey of oneness professor Ramna Jha ji For setting the tone of this entire discussion I would very kindly request professor Ramna Jha to please kindly come forward and set the tone for this panel discussion. Professor Ramna Jha ji is a very senior faculty member at Jawana Nehru University located in New Delhi. He's associated with the field of social sciences with specific focus on political science, sociology. But apart from all these disciplines, what makes him stand apart is his understanding of Upanishads, Vedas, and Advaita Vedanta, and his love for Shankaracharya. So I would very kindly request sir to come forward and take the stage.

Our honorable Swami Mitranand ji respected Eric and faculty member and researchers and other audience. I welcome all of you and, with my pranam to you. I present the Advaitic model of environment. Actually, the Upanishadic model or Upanishadic understanding of reality is based on the the basic and the principle statement that is truth is one, but it presents or it manifests itself into this pluralistic universe. So there are five major statements in Upanishads.

First, statement related with the manifestation of reality. Second, statement related with the sustenance of this reality. Third, statement related with the the dissolving of this reality. Fourth, the statement related where that consciousness, the supreme consciousness is already there in manifestation. And fifth, that supreme consciousness residing everywhere, controlling everything from within.

So, these are five statement, statements. One is Second is the Stithi vak, yena jatani jivanti. Third is the Pralay vak, yat priyantavisambhishanti. Fourth is the Prabhesh vak, tutch rishta tutch rishta tutch rishta devanuk prabishat, and fifth is the niyaman vakya. Niyaman vakya means bhita bhita is So with these five statements, the same truth, the same consciousness is everywhere.

And it takes different forms, name and forms only with its power. So the whole universe is nothing but the power itself, the Sakti itself. And as Adi Shankarachar, Sage in Vivek Shuramani, So it is Maya, it is Sakti through which the whole universe came into existence. So with its power that consciousness is everywhere and this is the actual position of a duet. And with this kind of understanding, we can take another month.

So this is the clear position of Advaita Vedanta that that consciousness is everywhere. Whether we can capture it through our sense organ and whether it is in that state where our sense organ can't capture, But consciousness is everywhere, first issue. Second, we have also concept of devta. What does it mean, devta? So Rishi said, Nirukta kar said, Deva Danath.

I accept that reality as Devata which unconditionally provide everything for us. In this way, as per our openistic wisdom, Prithvi is Devata because Prithvi is providing everything for us unconditionally. Because what percentage of water is in our body that has been decided by process of nature. What percentage of heating process in our body that has been decided by process of nature. We can't decide what temperature will be in our body.

What temperature is outside of this body, what temperature of this earth. This is the main issue of environment, global environment. What we are facing today that if this heat or temperature increases 1.5 degree, that can create all types of problems. And I P C C four, now I P C C six that is giving report, this kind of report. Similarly, we accept Vayu as Devata because what percentage percentage of oxygen is in environment that is decided by a process of nature.

And if it increases, that is also dangerous for nature and if it decreases, that is also dangerous. So, the actual ratio of the oxygen or other gases are decided by natural process. Similarly, other deities. So this is very important concept of why we focus always on devta. Why to worship Devata?

Because we have to first oblige to Devata because through that process we are sustaining. And also, they are a kind of giving and take taking up. Bhagwan Krishna in Gita clearly says, means if you take care of, devata means natural deities or natural process, then it will also take care of you. And by mutual taking care of each other, you will reach the state of happiness. And one step ahead, There is a kind of cyclic process between human being and nature.

And if someone doesn't know this process and violates the natural law, then he is supposed to be papi. In our tradition, papi punya is not existing, but for environmental process issues. Bhagwan clearly said that those people are a puppy who would who do not understand the cyclic process of human being and nature. So that is aghayu. Aghayu means they are exploiting as Smriti has clearly mentioned.

They are exploiting nature. Nature for pleasing or for just just for their sense organ and other organs. So they are asur. Asur is very important term in Indian tradition. Who are ever for for the material pleasure and trying to satisfy their sense organs through exploiting nature.

Those persons are supposed to be asura and others are there because who are for the welfare of society, who are taking minimum from nature and in this way, they sustain then themselves by taking minimum from nature and also, and also they always take care of nature to protect it. So in this way, there is also devasura sanghram. Devasur sangharam means who exploits nature and who is taking care of nature. So there is a kind of always fight between Dev and Asura. So this is also one of the issues we must address.

And in Advaitic tradition, as all forms of nature are divine because their consciousness is is residing. So all forms are divine. So Adi Shankaracharya had composed all slokas, many slokas for protecting nature to give it a a divine st stature. For example, they are always singing, If we think from environmental point of view, so Acharya says that I worship narmada. But what type of narmada?

A Narmada that is giving shelter to fish, giving shelter to crocodile, giving shelters to plants, trees, other worlds. So as in Narmada is giving shelter to everyone, in this way I worship Narmada. You know, similarly, he has written Yamuna'shtakam. You know Achar says that, Yamuna is slow so clean and Yamuna is with so purity and with so many positive properties that if someone is mentally unhealthy, if someone is physically unhealthy, if he visits Yamuna, he will get healthy and and, he will come back with happiness. So this kind of yamna we have and, of course, Gangaji.

Today also I said there, You know, he says that, I will prefer to to live in on the bank of Ganga as fish, as tortoise, as as as a just go kat them chipkili. So a very lean and thin chipkili, but I will not prefer to be a king that is in the distant, form of this Ganga. So this kind of divinity we have regarding river. Similarly with, mountains, the other forms of nature. So this is Advaitic view of natural reality.

So this is one aspect. This is the world view of Advaita philosophy. But now we also think of the other world view. The other world view as Smriti mentioned there, the other world view starts from Lucifus and Democritus and Rene Descartes concludes it. And Rene Descartes concludes it with understanding that there is a mind matter duality.

And what is mind? Who thinks, who thinks is the mind and who doesn't think is the matter. And there is a clearly distinction between a thinking being and a non thinking reality. So as per Rene Descartes, other than human being, other than human being, that and that only thinks, other than human being in non thinking reality. And as per his understanding, even animals, plants and other aspect aspects of reality are non thinking reality.

So those are made only for the utility of human being. In this way, human being is totally different from nature and nature is made for just exploitation. So if you exploit more and more, you will develop your economy, you will develop your power, and you can dominate over nature and you can dominate among other people. You know the one of the aspect is a human being is the thinking being, but there is a gradation within thinking beings. Yes.

Yes. Fritjesh of Kaprad and others raised this issue that even there are degrees. High thinking low human being and low thinking human being. So if you are with that kind of mindset, you can also dominate over low thinking human being. So this is also an environmental issue.

So low thinking human being and other than human human being, these are for the exploitation. So this is one aspect and, the material aspect of Rene Descartes became the the object of Newtonian science and that started the material development in scientific arena. So this is one aspect. But in European tradition as well, so many biologists a German biologist named Ernst Haeckel. Ernst Haeckel came in 1866 and started to study the relationship between human being and other than human being.

So he thought, is there any relation between human being and other than human being? That was a project of biology. And after that he found that yes, there is a relation and to study relationship between human being and other than human being is the meaning of the term ecology, which was coined by Ernest Heckel. So ecological study was started, initiated. And after so many years, around 1970, and what name I am, I am giving, taking before you, he is belonging to the same country from where Eric is belonging and that is Arne Nes.

Arne Nes went one step further and he coined deep ecology. Deep ecology because he divided ecology into two parts, shallow ecology and deep ecology. Shallow ecology, you can say almost hijacked by the materialist. Then he coined another term deep ecology. Deep ecology means when you ask the deeper question of nature.

When you go to the deeper aspect of nature, you will find that there is different structure. So now through sense organ, we see each one is different from others. But when you go to the deeper aspect of your same personality and the nature, you will find that everyone is connected with each other. So if everyone is connected with each other, also David Worm experimented that even a a an electron is a is connected with other electrons even in the other galaxy without any time gap. This kind of relation is in the deeper state of reality.

So if you have that kind of knowledge, then we'll clearly understand that if you if you exploit nature, it means we are exploiting ourselves. And then the unification theory that the one force or one power is the is the source of other powers or other forces. This is other development another development in the scientific area. So with that kind of understanding, now even UNO is very much conscious and, he is belonging to the UNPP, environmental program, and, now UNO says that you you go to nature and, you lead your natural life, then you can sustain and then the nature can be protected. So now when our So all forms of nature is the manifestation of the same consciousness.

Okay? Now you see the statement of rnaness. He said, if you deepens your understanding, that nature is nothing but your extension, then you can protect nature without any making proper effort as you don't effort to to inhale and exhale. You know, you inhale and exhale without any special effort. Similarly, if you think that this is your extension, then you can protect nature without any making special effort.

So this kind of philosophy has been initiated by Arnie Nash and this is known as deep ecological movement at global level. So, and he is also the scholar of Upanishad and Gita. So finally, a Dwaitic thought went to Arlene Nesh and it came in the form of deep ecological movement, that is the contribution of Advaita philosophy. So with this kind of understanding, we are we have been thinking, we are thinking now, and if we understand this world view properly, I think the nature can be protected and by protecting nature, we can protect our self and this is the only solution. Yes, we we try to improve our technology, but as per my understanding, this technology cannot take you to the very far.

It will react again. But if you have proper understanding of nature, then you can sustain yourself by taking minimum from nature. You know in our Advaitic tradition, Prakriti or nature is our is our mother. You know? Says, actually the whole manifest is festation is from shakti.

So shakti and prakriti and even our earth, all are in the form of mother in our Advaitic tradition. So as children takes from mother, everything taking from mother, but not taking so much to kill mother. You know, similarly we have to take from nature to sustain our self, but not take so much that that nature can be destroyed. So, this kind of understanding we should have and, with one more example, I will be closing my talk that this is the Advaitic position with which we have been accepted Prithvi as our mother, you know. The whole universe the whole universe even you can say whole globe is exploiting earth but it is a dvaitic position which accept Prithvi as mother.

This is from Atharveda, you know. And, you know, after Arnie Nes, he when he developed a deep ecological movement, then a committee was set up. You know, so many geologists started research whether earth is alive or dead, you know, and after research, it was found that whatever is on the upper side of earth, that is nothing but the manifestation of the inner process of earth, you know. So there is a kind of identical relation between the inner process of earth and the outer manifestation. So, if outer manifestations where we all are, where plants are, where animals are, if they are alive, how can earth be dead?

You know, with that kind of research, with that kind of research, finally they concluded that earth is not a dead reality. Earth is alive and with the recommendation of geologists, a committee was set up by UNO and then earth charter 2,000 was prepared. Earth charter 2,000 is on the website. You can see there and maximum point of earth charter have been taken from this tradition, the Vedic tradition, and the first line of the preamble. Earth, our home is alive.

The intention is that you should treat earth as you treat human being, you know. And lastly, in a Dwedic tradition, we have four kinds of jeeb. No. Four kinds of jeev. That is jadayuj.

Jadayuj means all human being. Andaj, all birds. Udvij, all types of plants and Shwedaj, all types of insects. They have been accepted as jiva, as conscious reality, as living reality. But as per Rene Descartes, it is only human being that is conscious other than human being is non conscious.

So there is a one type of world view and this is another that is Advaitic world view. So, these are two world views and if you are trained to understand the distinction between two world views, then you can justice properly and I think if we all are trained in Advaitic world view, that is the call of the globe and that is the mandate of UNO and that is mandate of everyone even UNPP that we can protect nature and without protecting nature, you can we cannot protect ourselves. So this world view has to be take to the UNO, to other forums where people should be trained to understand the structure of the whole universe and the position of consciousness in this nature. And accordingly, we should we should take minimum from nature as Isabasi Upanishad said, 10 tyakten bhunjita. This is the model of Advaita.

We should take minimum from nature. And don't be greedy. Lastly, giving one example of Mahatma Gandhi ji when he was on the bank of Savarmati. So, generally he used to go to the river part and took one lota of water, you know. And again coming climbing the that and coming to the ashram.

So he is secretary Pandya. He said once that, Why are going time and again to the flowing river and coming back? I will take one balti of water and it will be comfortable for you. Madhava Gandhi replied, No, no, no, no, no. I need only one lot of water.

Savarmati is not flowing for myself only. It is flowing for all creatures. It is satisfying all forms of nature. I need one lota of water, so I will go time and again. No problem.

Let the river flow for others and this kind of world view is the Advaitic world view of environment. Advaitic world view of ecology. I think this is the positioning of a dual philosophy from environmental point of view, from ecological point of view and I think after discussion we can go further. Thank you so much for giving me the pleasure. Thank you very much, professor Jhaji.

I am sure you all, can't wait to witness this enlightening discussion. I'll very quickly introduce you to, another panelist. Swami Mitranan Saraswati ji, he's a spiritual teacher and the most dynamic sannyasi you'll ever come across. His guru, Puja Swami Chinmayanand ji, you in his literature used to call Shankara the fittest spiritual general. We all very lovingly call Swamiji the fittest lieutenant.

That's what we call him. He's known for his teachings that focus on self realization and understanding the nature of the self, often emphasizing the importance of inner well-being, mindfulness, and the pursuit of spiritual go growth, specifically among youngsters. Our other panelist and the guest of honor today, we have mister Eric Sohem, who's a Norwegian diplomat, environmentalist, and politician known for his work in international peace negotiations and sustainable development. He served as the executive director of United Nations Environment Program from 2016 to 2018 and has been a strong advocate for climate action, green technology, and environmental conservation. Before leading UNEP, mister Soham was Norway's Minister Of Environment And International Development, playing a key role in the global climate negotiations and peace processes, particularly in Sri Lanka and Sudan.

He's also recognized for promoting collaboration between governments, businesses, and communities to drive environmental conservation and change. Currently, he continues his work as an adviser on green development and sustainability, engaging with different international organizations and initiatives focused on climate resilience and ecological conservation. And as I mentioned earlier, that now he's in the journey of oneness with us. He's our, ambassador. He's the ambassador for this entire initiative that we are doing.

So I would now request all of you to be extremely attentive and just enjoy this, beautiful discussion that's going to take place. Checking. Little volume, please. Checking. Thanks.

My salutations to mister Eric and, our dear professor, Ramnaji. Can I start with a question? You guys are young, was attending to what Ramnaji was saying. How many scientists and how many books he referred in his talk? I always call him no.

You don't have to worry now. The names, I always call him a moving encyclopedia. And whenever I have to introduce him, I have always done that. Here is a moving encyclopedia. You scratch him, and wisdom keeps coming out.

I'll continue this discussion, taking a cue from what, Ramnaji said. Professor was talking about a verse in the Bhagavad Gita, the verse which says, you take care of devas. Devas, in turn, will take care of you. Supporting each other, serving each other. May you progress and may you attain the highest good.

Now who are these devas? Ramdaji said very clearly, earth is a deva. Fire is a deva, air, vayu is a deva, agni, vayu, varuna, Pritivi. We see all this as deva. So here is our instruction.

You take care of devas. They in turn will take care of you taking care of each other. Taking care of each other, may you attain highest good, not ordinary, not mediocre. May you attain the highest good. This is a powerful message for the human beings.

It is our responsibility to take care of nature. Deva, nature. We take care of them. In turn, nature would support us and take care. In fact, Krishna goes little more further and says in the same chapter how the nature will take care of you.

The nature will come and support you like a dasa. You understand dasa? Dasa is a person who's committed to service. Sevak, like a Sevak coming and serving, the nature would support us. That's why in that chapter tenth verse, chapter three of the Gita, Krishna says, Verse number 10, chapter three.

Now this is a beautiful way of saying, when the creation was made, when this creation happened, at that time, he said that this creation is made with the. Creation is made along with. What is? Like Ramnaji was saying, is you take little what you actually require. That example of Gandhi going into the river, you take only little.

What is required, you take, give more. Giving more than what we consume, that sensitivity we should have. So saha yagna, along with this yagna, this creation is made. Yagna means coming together. In the spirit of togetherness, I shed my selfishness, and we work collectively.

Together, cooperatively, when we work, you may attain whatever you want. Devas, humans, everybody, we should work with Yajna spirit. Nature is taken care. Environment is taken care when we work with the spirit of Yajna. Yajna spirit means all of us working together.

Together when we serve, we get. And he says, let this be Let this be your wish fulfilling cow. Is our cow. Whatever you want, this cow gives you. Let the spirit of togetherness and being together, Let the spirit of togetherness be your.

It's a powerful verse. Whatever you want to fulfill in this world, do it in this spirit. That is the law which we should do. We miss that law and we miss everything. The cord which holds everything together, again in the Gita.

The cord which holds all the pearls together, the beads together, similarly, the spirit of togetherness holds the universe together. If we adopt that method, everything would be like giving more than what we take, and we look at nature as our own being, not something to be exploited. For us, nature is worshiped. Why? In Sanatana Dharma, we strongly believe the creator is divine.

The created is divine. In sanatana dharma, this is our belief, and it is a fact. That's where the Advaita comes. Everything is the same divine. The creator and the created, both are divine.

So when we look at nature, when we look at rivers, when we look at mountains, we see it as divine. That has to be incorporated back into our way of life. And the Sanatan way of life is the best example for sustainability. People sitting here, I have a simple question. You don't have to answer, but you have want you to think.

How many people are there there with you at home in each family? Four, five? In a family? Four, five? Earlier, we were little more larger.

So what? You live in two bedroom apartment? Three bedroom maximum? Four, five people live under one roof. Together, family.

Now imagine if each individual wants an apartment. If each individual wants an apartment and I want to live alone, I want an apartment for myself. How many more trees we will chop? How much more forest we will erase? Our family way of life is sustaining is sustainability.

We say, yes. Let's live under one roof as one family. Let's adjust and be there. In fact, in the past, our way of life was even more. I grew up in a joint family.

We have 45 people living together, first few years of my life. Imagine 45 people, and every child is growing. If my cousin was born few years elder to me, what he wears, clothes, etcetera, would be given to us. Because he grows up, he doesn't fit in, and it'll come to us. We have to wear it.

Sustainability, you don't chuck it out. You don't you are using it to maximum. Our lifestyle itself was so beautifully connected to sustainability. Take minimum from nature and give maximum. So this is from the Gita standpoint.

I thought I'll add up to what Ramnaji said. Now we lead this conversation to Eric. Eric, thank you so much for coming here. You had a very long day, a tedious day. And he was on the road from morning, 11AM, the flight landed.

09:30. And he reached us by six, 05:30, six. Can you imagine the patience? And that's kumbh for you. And this is mah kumbh.

And, yeah, I I tell it's not our it's not humans walking. Here in Kumbh, you see faith walking. It's not humans. It's, it's faith which is moving. What is in motion is faith.

So he was patiently went through all that, made it. We are very proud that you're here. The floor is all yours. Eric, please go ahead. Well, a very good afternoon to Prade Grouch.

I'm so happy to be with you at the Mahakombe. Really, in my entire life, I had dreamed of once to come to Kumbh Mela, and now I'm here. And my friend, you are right. I spent more time from the airport here than I spent from Europe to Delhi on the aircraft. Why?

Because there are so many people here. This is by far without any competition, the largest spiritual event on planet Earth. But it's more. It's the largest event, the largest gathering of any sort of humanity anywhere in the world. There is nothing similar in America, Europe, China, Africa, nowhere else.

This is absolutely unique. Tomorrow 25,000,000 people are expected here. Well, that's a bit more than the population of Sri Lanka, a bit less than the population of Nepal. It's a medium sized country coming here tomorrow. So just to really hammer in how important this is and how we blessed we are to be here.

The topic of our discussion is we are facing a triple environment crisis. I think you're all aware. You have seen on TV the horrible firestorms in California destroying homes of Hollywood Stars. Yes. But more importantly, destroying the homes of absolutely ordinary, also poor Americans.

That is a function of climate change. You're also aware that we have horrible pollution. Delhi in November, December was so polluted. It was really dangerous for our health if we were to breathe the Delhi air, and we are destroying different ecosystems, animals, plants, and forest. All these have to change.

And then we need to change our practice and we need to change our thinking. The good the very good news is that we have the ability to do both. The new practice is there really right in front of us. Solar energy is now the cheapest energy anywhere in the world. When prime minister Modi has made himself the main promoter of solar energy, he said India should have one crore 10,000,000 rooftops with solar energy.

Why did they do that? Because it's very good economics bringing people out of poverty, but very good for the environment all the same. We have for the first time in human history the ability to live prosperous, comfortable, good lives without destroying nature. That's opportunity of the new practice that we also need to change our thinking. And that's what what my two colleagues had talked about.

I mean, for far too long, the wrong thinking dominated humanity. And I have to say a little shameful that that thinking was particularly strong in the West. That thinking was humans are far above nature. We can kill animals. We can destroy plants.

We can burn down forests. We can destroy rivers. We can do everything with our pleasure if it helps us. But look, this thinking is absolutely non scientific. It's a frontal attack on everything we know from modern science and it's also not common sense.

If we were all to die tomorrow, panelists, all of you, well, mother earth will do very well. Mother earth will hardly be affected at all. We humans depend on mother Earth. Mother Earth don't really depend on us. Mother Earth will remain for billions or more years in all its beauty if we humans were to disappear, we cannot live one day without mother earth.

Some people believe they can because they're living in very urban settlement and may not see many trees in their daily life that we everything from everything we're eating, the air we're breathing, everything is depending on mother earth. I will need to change that thinking. That's of course thank you. It's a please give applause for that. It's it's very important.

And that's, of course, why we're here to celebrate Adi Shankara or Adi Shankara Sharia. You know, he was born in Kerala, came to Unkaneswar in Madhya Pradesh, and then went, I think, on three major trips, walking around in Barat. It was, of course, no motorized transport those days, but basically he was walking. And he conquered Barat not with weapons, but with his brain, his mouth, and his discussions. And it's a wonderful story.

I'm not aware that anywhere else on planet Earth you had these debates where the best, most sophisticated people of the time would sit down debating their ideas and the power of other Shankara. Was that he, I may be wrong to say, won these debates because debates are not about winning, it's about shaping their thinking. But he had massive impact through his ability to debate, and he changed the perspectives of India and then the world. And look, this happened at a time where India was the dominant intellectual power. For fifteen hundred years, basically from February before Christ to thirteen hundred after Christ, India was the intellectual center of planet Earth with the Hindu dharma, with Buddhism, and in modern mathematics.

And to the real, real, really, honor of India. These ideas basically spread through intellectual debates, through intellect intellectual persuasion, through trade, not through military conquest, which has been the normal way of sharing ideas in most other parts of the world. So it really puts in the in the most brilliant spot, sharing ideas and conquering the world with ideas. Look. The biggest Buddhist temple in the world is in Indonesia.

The biggest Hindu temple in the world is in Cambodia, but, of course, they are coming from India. The old capital of Thailand was called Ayodhya. Well, it's Ayodhya, just another in a Thai Thai version of the same name. So India conquered the world with his ideas, and now the Shankaracharya was so consequential for this. Then came colonialism.

And the Brits could not conquer India if they accepted that the Indian civilization was superior. Not even if they had accepted that the Indian civilization was equal to the Western civilization civilization it would be meaningful to conquer India. That could only be based on the idea that the Indian civilization was inferior. Why would you spread your own civilization if you believe the other is above you or equal to you, then you go into a discussion and a dialogue, not a forceful, convert con converting people. But now so for hundreds of years, through the work of many western scholars, Hindu dharma was seen as an inferior theo theology, inferior thinking, but now it looks so modern because it comes again with this idea that man, humanity, and nature is one.

We can only survive as part of nature, and we should show respect to all other living beings, whether animals or plants or trees or whatever is there. They are not for us to conquer and destroy. They are there for us to live with. There are so many aspects of this in the Hindu dharma. Cause the veneration of rivers.

We are here now over the confluence of the Ganga and the Yamuna Rivers, respect for the cow as our mother, and indeed the whole Indian ancient Indians even made, god half human, half animal. Ganesh, half elephant, half human, but god. Hanuman, half monkey, half human, but god. Can there be a more strong way of symbolizing the closeness between humans and nature. And interestingly, because if these don't have practical, consequences, they're they're dead.

These have a very practical consequence. If I go back to my nation, Norway, we have basically no animal which is dangerous for human beings, with one exception, the polar bears, but they're living just up in the ice where there are no very hardly any people. No other, animal in Northern Europe is dangerous for humans. If a if a wolf in Northern Europe are killing not humans, but sheep, It will be immediately be liquidated by government agents who take out, as it is said, that wolf. Well, in India, a number of people are killed every year by elephants.

I think it's about four hundred on average. About fifty are killed by tigers in India every year. Fifty humans killed by tigers. 400 by elephants. If an elephant and a tiger attack and kill a human, they will normally be replaced, not killed.

They'll be taken out of the habitat and put in another habitat where they don't do the same damage, and that's such a wonderful respect for nature. So it shows that is just not just theory. It has practical consequences. What do you think? But my main message is we really need this old thinking, which is really the new thinking of humanity as a part of nature.

And you were so generous to speak about Arne Nez. He's one of the most extraordinary person coming from my nation, Norway. I met him and I knew him. He was a friend. He lived very long.

He was close to 100 when he died. Was a spectacular human being. He was also a war hero that fought the Germans during the second world war for the freedom of Norway, but he was also a brilliant thinking with this deep ecology, which again, of course, was very much inspired from India. Our next would be the first to say this thinking is not just coming from me, it's inspired from Gandhiji, but of course also from the ancient ancient Indians. Interestingly, there are similar thinkings in other parts of the world.

Few months back, I was in China, in a in a province of China called Shecheng. They had had what they called the He He culture. When I heard about the He culture, I thought, well, this is very similar to other Shankara. And interestingly, also, it's from the same time. Most of the He He culture, these are two Chinese characters, meaning unity in diversity.

Because we need to come together and stick together, but, of course, we will be different. There's a different thoughts, I mean, a different sexes, different ages. There are many differences between us that we need to come together. And this He He culture was an amalgam of the three main currents of Chinese thinking, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. So it was deeper also through Buddhism in influenced from India.

The first monks come from India and started this teaching in China. So what what do I mean to say with this? If you want to change the thinking of humans, it cannot just be an Indian thing, Must also be a European, an American, and Chinese thing, and we need to stick together people from different corners of the world with similar thinking, and we need to bring this into the United Nations and other institutions. Over the last two or three years, something very important happened in this regard because historically, UN was so dominated by the West. But then prime minister Modi made June 21 the International Yoga Day.

And and in December, '20 first of December was made the International Meditation Day. And these two days are not just two days. I mean, June 21 is when it turns from summer to winter, and December 21, of course, when it turns from winter to summer, it's the coldest and darkest day in the year. And from then onwards, it go up, And that's exactly why they picked that day as the International Meditation Day. And meditation and yoga are, of course, deeply influenced from India and are recognized by the world as global heritage, and we need more of these things.

And that's why I think also the the Saudis and Karashayra can be recognized globally as absolute important global heritage and inspire people at all corners of the planet. Thank you so much. Eric, that was very inspiring, and your insight on understanding Bharat and your drive to be in Kumbu is also very fine. I we have been discussing this for a while, and, in my nation, Shankara was forgotten long ago. That's a colossal mistake which we did.

The Advaitic philosophy was forgotten, and so was Shankara. It's after a very long time, there is a great awakening happening. And the philosophy what Shankara brought in to the public is the philosophy see, in in, Sanatana dharma, the gods are called Vishwanath. Vishwa means universe. Jagannath, lord of the world, lord of the universe.

So the philosophy Advaita philosophy is not just for, few Indians. Advaita philosophy is for the world, and I think the time has come now for us to take it forward. So lot of work is happening, and one such thing is, we had a meeting this morning, where we want to make an appeal to the United Nations, like yoga day, like, meditation day, that's actually for us. And, we want a day of oneness, Advaita. And that we wanted on Shankara's birthday.

So this particular thing, the Indian calendar is completely different from Gregorian calendar. So Indian calendar moves by thidi. So we are looking at and I want your view also in it. How do we bring this thiti idea to UN? And then, what are the steps we should take to get the United Nations declare Bhagwan Shankaracharya's Jan Madin as a day for oneness.

And, also, we would like to see the next decade dedicated to promote oneness by different nations. Like, all of us are very proud that when we did not have when we were attacked by COVID and we were the largest population. And in spite of that, India managed to share vaccine free to so many other countries. This is our Advaita. This is our Advaita because we see them also part of divine.

Creator created divine. The whole universe is one family. So this oneness India has already established. On one political issue, when it came to article three seventy of Kashmir, Turkey took a stand which was not in favor of Bharat. But, when Turkey had the earthquake, Bharat was the first to go there and help.

This is our Vasudeva Kutumbakam. So India has proved time and again what is this kind of oneness. So I want your inputs. How do we take this forward? Do you wanna sit?

Do you want us I think the critical issue to take such an idea forward is to get, people to align with it, meaning getting other nations or other institutions to support it because it's hard for one nation in India to carry it alone. As example, the idea of meditation was sponsored by a very small European nation called Liechtenstein. I mean, there are there are much, much fewer people in Liechtenstein than than the other within a perimeter 100 meter from here. It's very, very small. But still, they play a key role within their knowledge in promoting the idea of meditation.

So kind of bringing to gather a coalition of nations who can support Seshnadhi is the is the is the most most most critical. And also, it's important to really make the case that time has come to recognize a lot more the best practice from other parts of the world because, I mean, one of the most famous things of the UN is UNESCO world heritage sites. I think China now has the highest number, but I'm pretty sure that both Italy and France and Germany and a number of other European nations have more than India. As the Indian ambassador, to UNESCO once said, I mean, if you have a small red painted house in Northern Europe, it will be recognized as a World Heritage site, but even the greatest of temples in India, that does not happen. So, I mean, it's, of course, an affront to India, if I'm right, that there are more World Heritage sites in France and and Italy than in India.

Nothing wrong with France and Italy. I mean, that well deserved historical places. That was what I'm arguing. But, of course, India is so much bigger. As I said, it's such much much longer history and that is such big part in human history was the center of the world and these nations.

I mean, yes, it was during the Roman Empire. That's true, but not for most of history. So, this must be rectified. There must be a balance which is reflecting today's world. And in today's world, there should be many, many more world heritage sites from India compared to any other nation in the world with the possible ex exception of China.

So making that strong argument of historical fairness, but mainly bring a coalition of nations and institutions who will support that forward and to make the case. I think, we harnessed 54 nations for solar energy called Suryaputra. So we take the cue from you. There are 54 countries working together with Bharat on solar energy. I think, Surya, for us, the creator and the creator, both are divine.

We worship sun. I think those kind of nations, we should start looking at collaborating. And, definitely, like what you said, Ayodhya in Thailand and, the influence of Bharat across those countries should also be looked into. Okay. Ramnaji, you want to say anything?

I think one should add one more thing that is the one health system. So after corona, our prime minister also declared one health system Because if the whole globe is one family, then there should be one health system. And this is the initiative of India. So that is also the extension of Advait philosophy. Because more than hundred country were not in that position to buy vaccines.

So if, this type of calamity happens, then there must be one health system. So everyone has right to to live and everyone has right to live happily. So that can also be added as one of the component of of a duet thick extension. So this is my view. Thank you.

If I can add to that, I propose that, mister Pundovala, who is the industrialist in in Punde, and who's the head of the Serum Institute, which has been the number one maker of vaccines for the world's poor, should be given the Nobel Peace Prize. Yes. I think it's an absolutely no brainer. He has probably saved more lives than any other human being. Yes.

He's a businessman, but if you don't make it a business, it cannot work. But it's a business. This is very different because some of the Western medical companies, they make few vaccines with very high profit for the part of the world which can easily pay. What Poonawala was doing or is doing is making an enormous amount of vaccines at a very low price so that every nation and also the poor can have access to these vaccines. It's so so beautiful.

Prime Minister Modi also during the the COVID, time promoted this. But it's not just COVID. It's basically every other so every other disease that, the Ceremonies Institute in Pune is making the cheapest vaccines for the poor poor people of this world. Bharat has lived this Advaitic vision even in war. Even in Gita, Krishna says, To Arjuna, he says, Arjuna, don't have hatred, vengeance in you.

You are to fight the war you fight, but without these. Do not have hatred towards anyone. And we proved it, in our, Kargil war. Some of you were maybe we were not even born at Kargil war. When Kargil war happened, the soldiers from that side of, from the Pakistan country came and occupied Indian territories.

There was an agreement. In winter, both the countries will go back to the plains, and somewhere they'll come and come and occupy the, territorial posts in the mountains. India moved down according to the agreement, but the Pakistanis stayed back, later came and occupied Indian posts. This is what the war was about. We need to use our technology, etcetera, and regain reclaim every part.

And in this war, many, many Pakistani soldiers were dead, but Pakistan government could not claim them back. If they claim they are our citizens, then you have promoted terrorism. So they did not claim. Vajpayee was the prime minister at that time. He sent mullahs from Srinagar to go to all the hilltops and gave Pakistani soldiers Islamic funeral, Islamic burial.

Because there there are nobody to claim their body, and they're they belong they belong to that faith. Treated them that way. See, our Advaitic vision was never lost. It's just that, on the philosophical side, we forgot, but on the practice, on the living level, we kept this on always. Eric, you'd like to add anything before we wind up?

The you have mic there. I am occupying Adar as well. So actually the gradation of knowledge in Advaitic tradition that has been mentioned in the eighteenth chapter of Bhagavad Gita. So, you, if you are a person of wisdom, then you will have to fulfill those conditions which have been mentioned there and, knowledge has been divided into three parts. One is sattvic, other is rajas and third one is tamas.

So, a person of wisdom means, So, you are a person of wisdom if you understand the consciousness in everyone. Whether is it Pakistani or European and or South Asian people, at root level, at core level, we are the same. But at body level, or if there is a fight between two nations, so that is a process. But we have to understand the core of the people and in this way, Bajpayee ji did this kind of thing. That war is now over.

Those soldiers were were performing their duties. But now it's time for understanding the reality and he must give must be given regard for their Dharmic performance. So I think that was also the extension of Advaitic philosophy. Of course, the idea of oneness can also not only help us in the relationship between humans and nature, but also obviously in relations between humans. And if we agree that we are all one, they will be much easier to accept that in most cases, also the opposite side have some some argument, and they need to discuss, they need to find some compromise.

Because I have been involved in a number of peace processes, and the most important lessons learned from all of them in my view is the need for compromise. Because if you I if your idea is that you know the full truth and the others just need to be knocked down, well, it will normally lead to endless conflict. And this is not just between nations. It's in society. It's at every level of society.

I mean, think of your own family. If, say, your father decides that he will decide everything in the family. We'll decide what you will eat for every dinner, what entertainment you will have, what videos you will watch. Everything in the family will decide by your father. What is a recipe for disaster?

Everyone knows that. A family can only exist if it's compromised between man and woman, and also even between the parents and children, including close to grandparents. You need to find compromises which works for all. That extend itself to the sports club or to a nation like India or a coastal relationship between India, China, Europe, America, all all of them. We need to look to the fact that we are one, and we need to look to compromises which can make life work for all of us.

That's again consequence of the thinking of wellness. Yes, Smriti. Thanks for coming all the way, Eric. We enjoyed this conversation being with you. To be very honest with, you all, we don't want it to stop here at this note, but, yeah, I understand.

We have a time constraint. As we come to the close of this very profound discussion, my heart is filled with immense gratitude. Today we embark upon an intellectual and spiritual journey exploring how the timeless wisdom of Advaita can guide us in preserving environment and shaping a sustainable future in which togetherness or oneness with will be at the core. First and foremost, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to professor Ramna Jhaji from JNU whose, deep scholarly insights into Advaita Vedanta have illuminated our understanding of interconnectedness, not just among human beings, but with the entire cosmos. Your words have reminded us that true wisdom lies in seeing the world as one undivided whole.

Special thanks to Swami Mitranan Saraswati ji whose presence and teachings have inspired us all. Swamiji, your profound perspective on how spirituality and action should go hand in hand and has shown us that protecting nature is not just an external responsibility, but a deeply spiritual, deeply individual endeavor. Your words have kindled a sense of duty within us all. Thank you so much. And we are honored to have with us mister Eric Sohim.

His visionary words and his concern for the environment and for every single human being, were beautiful. Your insights on blending ecological responsibility with policy action have been invaluable. It's truly inspiring to see the how the philosophy of Advaita finds resonance in your advocacy for for environmental conservation. To all the dignitaries, scholars, and every atman present here, thank you for the for your enthusiastic, participation. It's it's it's an extremely engaging and curiosity driven discussion that we had here.

I would like to express my gratitude to all the volunteers, all the Shankar Dudes who sang for us, in the beginning. And everyone who's present here, thank I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart. We'll conclude this very beautiful evening, with a Shanti mantra. Kindly please have the Shanti mantra. I have a request to make.

I am extremely sorry. I I would kindly ask, Professor Ramna Jha ji to explain the Shanti mantra that we just did, for Eric ji. The meaning of this mantra, Vedic mantra is that, the consciousness is absolute and this universe which came out of this consciousness, that is also absolute And, if you take something out of this consciousness, it remain absolute. And finally, when it get dissolved into the consciousness, And you must respect the state of absoluteness and that lies in the protection of nature and that protection is the protection of the consciousness and of yourself. This is the meaning."

तुम्हारा जी जैसे मैंने भूमिका आपके सामने रखी है कि हमारा वृहत सनातन धर्म है लेकिन जो हमारी साइंटिफ़िक कम्युनिटी है खास करके इंटरनेशनल डोमेस्टिक इंडियन को हल्के नहीं लेते चीजों को समझते नहीं है लेकिन हमारा सनातन धर्म कहीं बहुत दीप है और आध्यात्म फिलोस्पी रिलिजन फेज की बात करता है लेकिन महाराज जी अगर मैं सांसारिक भोग विलासिता को जोड़ों जैसे कि मुझे अभी गर्मी लग रही है अचानक से आँधी तूफान बरसात आ गया या और किसी भी प्रकार की मेरे पास भौतिकी कमी है पैसे की कमी है किसी भी चीज़ की ऐसी बातें तो क्या अध्यात्म और यह भौतिकी जीवन आपस? 

Speaker 1  (00:59)
में जुड़े हुए हैं। 

Speaker 2  (01:01)
पहली बात तो जिसे हम भौतिक संसार कहते हैं ये भौतिक संसार बना कैसे हैं? इसी को हम कहते तत्व बोध पहले हमको एलिमेंट्स जिनके कारण संसार बनता इसकी रचना होती है पहले तो हमको उसका परिज्ञान होना चाहिए परिचित हैं जैसे कोई ईसाई जगह आदमी है तो वो कुछ न कुछ बाइबिल की बातें करेगा। इस्लाम जगत का कोई व्यक्ति है तो वह कहीं न कहीं कुरान की बात करेगा। कुरआन उनका धर्मशास्त्र है। बाइबिल उनका धर्मशास्त्र है। हम सनातन धर्मावलम्बियों का धर्मशास्त्र जो है वो श्रीमद् भगवत गीता है। श्रीमद भगवत गीता महाभारत काल में महाभारत में ही निकला है लेकिन यह ज्ञान पहले से था क्योंकि भगवद गीता में ही भगवान कृष्ण अर्जुन को कह रहे हैं कि जो बातें मैं तुझसे आज कर रहा हूं। यह बातें मैंने कभी सूर्य के साथ की थी तो अर्जुन को बड़ा आश्चर्य हुआ। आपका हमारा जीवन तो आज का है मैं तो बचपन से आपके साथ खेल कूद रहा हूँ सखा भाव से खेल कूद रहा हूं और फिर तुम्हारी प्रगति हमारी प्रगति हम देख रहे हैं पर तुम ऐसी बात बोल रहे हैं जो हमें अनसाइंटिफिक सी लग रही है अवैज्ञानिक सी लग रही है तो कब सूर्य को ज्ञान देने? 

Speaker 2  (02:22)
कब पहुंच गया? तुम तो अर्जुन को ज्ञान दे रहे बोले तुम नहीं जानते अपरम भाव तो जन्म हमारे आपके बहुत सारे जन्म हो चुके हैं। तुम उसे नहीं जानते हो मैं उसे जानता हूँ तब फिर भगवान कृष्ण ने वो सारा पूरा की वो कौन है व पुराण पुरुष व सनातन पुरुष व स्वयं अपने बारे में अर्जुन को ज्ञान करा रहा है जब ये कह रहा है इतनी पुरानी बात मैंने को ज्ञान दिया सूर्य को ज्ञान दिया इसका मतलब है सूर्य के समय से। वो सनातन पुरुष है। द्वापर का महानायक होकर के अर्जुन के साथ बैठा अर्जुन के रथ पर वो सारथी बना हुआ है तो आधुनिक संदर्भ में अर्जुन को अपनी परंपरा से जोड़ रहा है तो सनातन का अर्थ क्या हुआ मूल प्रश्न आपका सनातन है तो सनातन का अर्थ क्या हुआ जो अत्यंत प्राचीन हो अत्यंत पुराना हो और नित्य? 

Speaker 2  (03:18)
बना रहे उसका नाम है सनातन सनातन के डेफिनेशन है। अत्यंत प्राचीन सनातन तमाम परिवर्तनों के साथ अपरिवर्तनों में युग भी बदलते हैं। जो नए नए युग आते हैं उस युग के साथ जोड़ करके जो चलता है उसी का नाम सनातन है। सनातन कभी रूढ़ि नहीं होता वो रूढ़िवाद का समर्थन नहीं करता सनातन। प्राचीन और पुरातन होते हुए भी आधुनिकता का सम्मान करता है युगानुकूल समसामयिक और युग के अनुसार नवाचार इसके साथ सनातन करता अब एक बात तो आपको सनातन के बारे में क्लियर हो। अब दूसरी बात आपकी आती है कि हम अध्यात्म और धर्म दो प्रकार से समझा जाता है एक धर्म होता है प्रैक्टियोरिटिकल हमें कैसा जीवन जीना चाहिए? 

Speaker 2  (04:11)
तो धर्म का जो उपदेश शास्त्र है। अगर उसे आप पढ़ेंगे तो धर्म का उद्देश्यास कहता धर्मं आप धर्म के अनुसार चलिए सत्यमबद्ध आप सत्त बोलिए स्वाध्याय रचना भ्याम। मप्र स्वाध्याय करने में परस्पर वार्तालाप में प्रमाण नहीं करना चाहिए। उससे ही सब निकलता है धर्म सूत्रों के आधार पर चलता है धर्म नियमों के आधार पर चलता है तो हम मनुष्य हैं और हमारी उत्पत्ति मनुष्य से ही हुई ये किसी मनुष्य ने हमको बनाया तो हम मनुष्यों का आदिपुरुष कौन है? उसको हमने कहा मनू जी महाराज हमारे आदिपुरुष हैं उनकी धर्म पत्नी का नाम सतरूपा है मनु अरूपा ये स्वयंभू मनु हैं इनसे नर सृष्टि बनी है तो हमारे मनोजी महाराज ने जो कुछ भी हमारी आचार स्नेहिता बनाई है साइंटिफिक बिल्कुल नहीं है उन्होंने प्रकृति के साथ जोड़ करके बनाई। है और उसी श्रीमद्भगवद गीता में जब कृष्ण हैं उपदेश करते हैं अर्जुन को तो एक बड़ी अच्छी बात कहते हैं कि ये संसार बना कैसे पहले इस बात को तुम समझ लो। तो फिर बाकी बातें समझ में आएगी अध्यापक तो बहुत गहरा ज्ञान है पहले तो ज्ञान आपको नहीं है जब उतना ज्ञान नहीं है और आप अपने आप को धार्मिक कह रहे हैं तो इसका मतलब है धर्म के 

Speaker 2  (05:32)
आभास में आप जीवन जी रहे हो धर्म की ध्वनियों में आप जीवन जी रहे हो आप धर्म की गहराइयों में। नहीं पहुंच पाए हो। तरंगों में आप जीवन जी रहे हो इसलिए धर्म की गहराई को समझने के लिए धर्म का एक पहला सूत्र है या तो अभ्युदय श्रेयस सिद्धि संधर्म जिस साधन के द्वारा हमें 7 तक पहुंचने का बल मिलता है उस साधन को धर्म कहते हैं वो साधन कौन-कौन से हैं तो नैतिक आचरण जो जीवन? में नैतिक आचरण होता है उसे हम धर्म कहते हैं उसको उस पर चलना पड़ता है केवल सत्य बोलो धर्म पर चलो इतने कहने से तो हम धार्मिक नहीं होंगे। हम सत्यवादी नहीं होंगे इसे धर्म के स्वरूप को समझना हमारी जिम्मेदारी बनती है भगवान कृष्ण करेंगे तात्विक ज्ञान से यह बात मालूम होती है कि संसार बना कैसे यह संसार बना है भूमिराप नलो वायु खम मनोबुद्धिदेव च पृथ्वी जल तेज वायु और आकाश और इसमें बुद्धि और मन का नियोजन। किया गया बुद्धि किसकी है मनुष्य की बुद्धि? 

Speaker 2  (06:40)
बुद्धि किसकी परमात्मा बुद्धि है? जिस परमात्मा ने पृथ्वी जल तेज वायु आकाश बनाई जिसको पर्यावरण के मूल तत्व कहते हैं। इन्हीं का संग्रह जब बनता है विस्तार होता है उसी को पर्यावरण कहते हैं ना और पर्यावरण जो है कई अर्थों में काम करता है। पहले तो ये पर्यावरण के मूल तत्व है पृथ्वी जल तेज वायु आकाश और ईश्वर का मन क्योंकि उसकी इच्छा शक्ति के साथ पर्यावरण बने तो उसका मन जुडता है इसलिए हमको प्रकृति बहुत ज्यादा पसंद आती कोई भी व्यक्ति समुद्र के किनारे बड़ा प्रसन्न होता है किसी भी के किनारे। जाता है बड़ा प्रसन्न होता है। किसी पहाड़ में चला जाता है। ऊंचाइयों में तो वहां जाकर बड़ा प्रसन्न होता है फिर पहाड में जब वनस्पतियों का झुंड देखता है। वनाछादित पर्वत श्रेणियां देखता है तो वहां जाकर के प्रसन्न होता है। हिमालय में चला जाए तो वह ग्लेशियर है जो बर्फ ढका हुआ है उसको देख करके बड़ा पसंद होता है तो प्रकृति के किसी भी उपादान के करीब उसकी जो रिफाइंड स्वरूप है पहले तो पृथ्वी जल तेज वायु और आकाश। वही एक-दूसरे के साथ सम्मिश्रण हो जाता है तो वही प्रकृति बन जाता है वहीं पर्यावरण बन जाता है जब प्रकृति और पर्यावरण बन 

Speaker 2  (07:54)
जाते हैं तो उसी। मौसम तैयार हो जाता है हमारे भारतवर्ष में ऋतु कही गई है 6 ऋतुएं होती हैं और 2 2 मास के अंतराल से आती है कभी बसंत ऋतु आ जाती तो कभी ऋतु आ जाती है तो कभी दूसरी ग्रीष्मकाल आ जाता तो कभी शीतकाल आ जाता है तो यह मौसम है इसको हम। कहते हैं वैज्ञानिक इस बात को मानते हैं और हम भी इस बात को मान रहे अध्यात्म में और भौतिक विज्ञान में बहुत अंतर नहीं है। भौतिक विज्ञान केवल थ्योरी तक ही सीमित रहता है और आध्यात्म में विज्ञान जो होता है वह प्रैक्टिकल में आ जाता है। अब देखिए भौतिक विज्ञान क्या क्या? 

Speaker 2  (08:31)
उसने कहा कि पृथ्वी जल तेज वायु आकाश या 5 तत्वों से सारा संसार बना हुआ है। संसार में सारी सृष्टि बनी हुई है सारी सृष्टि के जितने उपादान है इसमें जितनी खूबसूरती बनी हुई है बडे बडे वनस्पति है और इतनी इतने परमात्मा की तूलिका ऐसी चली है कि 1 1 पक्षी को साथ-साथ। पाँच-पाँच रंगों में रंग दिया हम उसके रंगों का विश्लेषण करते रहते मयूर तो भारतवर्ष में जो पाया जाता है तो अलग प्रकार का है ये हरा और काले का और कुछ है। कलरों का कॉम्बिनेशन है लेकिन यही मयूर जब दूसरे देश में मिलता है हमको दूसरे जलवायु दूसरे वातावरण। में तो वो और आकर्षक दिखता है तो लगता है कि चित्र विचित्रात्मक सृष्टि जो है उस परमात्मा ने बनाई है इसी को प्रकृति कहते हैं। प्राकृतिक संरचना कहते हैं और इसी को हम पर्यावरण कहते हैं पर्यावरण माने जितना कुछ वनस्पति। जितना कुछ है हमको पर्वतों में दिखाई पडा। छोटे छोटे पौधे नन्हें पौधों में दिखाई पड़ा छोटी सी धूप में दिखाई पडा वो व्यर्थ नहीं है। एक छोटी सी भी अगर कड़ी है तो पर्यावरण का सबसे छोटा उपादान है और इसलिए सूत्र आता है हमारे वैज्ञानिक भाषा बोल रहा हूँ मैं साइंटिफिक भाषा बोल रहा हूँ महतो 

Speaker 2  (09:46)
महियान जो छोटे से छोटे कण में भी जीवन शक्ति है और बडे से बड़े विस्तार में जीवन शक्ति है। इसी का नाम है प्रकृति प्राकृतिक संरचना इसी का नाम सृष्टि और इस सृष्टि में वह सब है जिसमें एक मनुष्य भी घुसा। हुआ है और चींटी से लेकर हाथी पर्यंत जीव घुसे हुए इस प्रकृति से जुड़े हुए हैं। हर एक कोई ने प्रकृति का अवलंब लिया क्योंकि चींटी का भी अपना एक मन है। हाथी का भी अपना मन है, चींटी और हाथी के बीच में जितने जीव जंतु हम देख रहे हैं उनका सबका मन है और सबका मन प्रकृति से जुड़ा हुआ है क्योंकि इसे अष्टधा प्रकृति कहा गया है 8 प्रकार से इसके लक्षण है जलवायु बुद्धि अहंकार मान्यता अहंकार का मतलब है स्वीकार्यता मान्यता हम। नकारात्मक को भी स्वीकार करते हैं और सकारात्मक को भी स्वीकार करते हैं एक वैज्ञानिक चंद्रयान भेज रहा है। चंद्रमा में जा रहा है और चंद्रयान ध्वस्त हो गया नहीं पहुंच पाया उसको नकारात्मकता स्वीकार हो गई। रोधन हुआ मैं अपने मिशन में असफल रहा। भारत का प्रधानमंत्री वैज्ञानिक कोई बात नहीं एक चींटी 7 बार चली दीवार पर लेकिन हिम्मत नहीं आ रही 8वीं बार चलकर के अपने लक्ष्य में पहुँच गई तो कभी कभी हमारे अंदर 

Speaker 2  (11:06)
नकारात्मक भाव आते हैं हमारे अंदर विफलता के भाव आते हैं तो विफलता हमें पीडा देती लेकिन अंदर से एक साहस भी जागता है कि नहीं हमें काम करना चाहिए। आखिर चंद्रयान गया कि नहीं गया चंद्रयान गया कि नहीं चंद्रमा में खोज कर रहा है कि नहीं कर रहा है तो जिस 2nd लाइट के युग। में हम जी रहे हैं जिस ग्लोबलाइजेशन के युग में हम जी रहे हैं तो पूरी दुनिया एक-दूसरे के निकट है और पूरी दुनिया 2 3 बातों पर चिंतन कर रही है कि जलवायु का प्रयोग। प्रकृति अपना मूल स्वभाव को छोड़ रही है यह पहले भी हो चुका है जब राम का जन्म हुआ था तब भी नन्हें नन्हें पौधों ने अपना स्वभाव बदल दिया था सब फल-फले राम हित लागी भगवान तो जंगल में जा रहे हैं और जिस प्रकृति का उत्पादन करता है जिस प्रकृति का। निर्माण करता है जिस प्रकृति का सृजन करता ही जा रहा है तो प्रकृति ने अपना स्वभाव बदल दिया हमेशा गर्मी में। लेकिन ठंडी में भी आम मिलने लगा जो जो पौधे जो पुष्प देते थे पुष्पों का जो पराग वितरण करते थे उनके हेतु से हटकर के भी क्योंकि हमारा प्रकृति का जो पुरुष है जो प्रेरणा देता है प्रकृति को वही आया है तो प्रकृति ने स्वभाव बदल दिया आज जो वातावरण देश 

Speaker 2  (12:16)
में बना हुआ है क्योंकि आज वैज्ञानिक। अपनी भाषा में जो बोल रहे हैं तो क्या बोल रहे हैं कि इस समय जो है वो ग्लोबल वार्मिंग हो रही है। ग्लोबल वार्मिंग हो रही है। का मतलब क्या है कि पृथ्वी का तापमान बढ रहा है और पृथ्वी में जीवन होता है। इसलिए तापमान उतना ही होना चाहिए जितनी प्रकृति के जो उपादान है चींटी से लेकर हाथी पर्यंत मनुष्य आदि जीतते हैं वो प्रकृति के इस वातावरण में रह सके इतना प्राप्त पृथ्वी में जरूरी है लेकिन अब पृथ्वी तब रही और पृथ्वी तो मौसम में भी कुछ इधर-उधर परिवर्तन हो रहा है यह एक। विषय हुआ लेकिन जब आप अमेरिका जाते हैं जब आप कनाडा जाते हैं जहां इंग्लैंड आते हैं तो वहां तो दूसरे दिन ही आपको अनुभव होने लगता है कि भारत में सूर्य इतने पहले होगा था या सूर्य इतने बजे हुआ है तो लोग जो घूमता है पृथ्वी का ये साइंस की खोज हम भी मानते कि पूर्वार्ध और उत्तरी। दक्षिणी आध्यात्मिक मान रहा है और आज का भौतिक विज्ञान भी मान रहा है तो इनका परिवर्तन होता है। जोड़ा हुआ था तो जब यह ग्रहण क्षेत्र अपने अपने चक्र में घूमते हुए अपनी अपनी परिधि में घूमते हुए इधर-उधर होते हैं तो मौसम का परिवर्तन होता है।

इसमें कोई आचरण नहीं करना चाहिए पर इस मौसम परिवर्तन के साथ जो जीवों को हानि होने लगती है। अगर पृथ्वी सामान्य तापमान में बगीचे में जी रही है घूम रही है पुष्पों का पराग पान कर रही है उन सारे वनस्पतियों का आश्रय लेकर अगर वही प्रकृति। जब वो धरती तापमान से ग्रसित होगी तो जीवन उसका मुश्किल हो जाएगा ऐसे मनुष्य के साथ हो रहा है हमको जिस मौसम में ठंड लगनी चाहिए उस मौसम में गर्मी को पंखे क्यों चलाने पड रहे हैं तो यह मौसम परिवर्तन जो होता रहता है प्रकृति का खेल है यह प्रकृति का नजारा मनुष्य का चिंतित होना। इसलिए मनुष्य अपना जीवन ढूंढता है प्रकृति के मध्य इसलिए मनुष्य प्रकार की चिंता व्यक्त करता है और पूरे विश्व का अगर पृथ्वी का तापमान जो है गर्म हो रहा है। तो आप अपनी पत्नी को तो देख लो पहले उस विराट पृथ्वी को बाद में देखो पहले खुद को भी तो समझो तब तो का मतलब है कि प्रकृति के साथ वीएसटी का संबंध क्या है? 

Speaker 2  (14:24)
प्रकृति के साथ व्यस्ती का संबंध क्या है? व्यक्ति का संबंध क्या है हम प्रकृति के प्रकृति के प्रकृति में परिवर्तन है तो हमारी प्रकृति में परिवर्तन दिखाई पड़ेगा। वाद कप्प और मित्र ये 3 चीजें हमारी प्रकृति के का गुप्ता निरीक्षण करती हमारी प्रकृति का नियमन करती है समान और समानुपात वाद का पित्रकार कफ का होना चाहिए तब हमारे शरीर का संतुलन रहता है अगर पित्त भड़क गया यह आवाज़ भटक गया दिया तो बीमार हो जाएंगे तो उसके लिए हमें औषधि इसी। दृष्टि से इसी प्रकार इसी समस्या से लेना पड़ता है और दवाई लेकर के हम इसको औषधि के रूप में ले लेते तो प्रकृति पोषण भी करती है प्रकृति आहार भी देती है प्रकृति आवाज़ भी देती है प्रकृति संरक्षण भी देती है इसलिए पर्यावरण की चर्चा बड़ी तेजी के साथ चल रही है उसके लिए क्या करना चाहिए किन? 

Speaker 2  (15:18)
कारणों से प्रकृति ऐसी हो रही है जिन कारणों से ग्लोबल वार्मिंग हो रही है तो जो नदियां हैं। वह अपनी स्वाभाविक गति से प्रवान हो उनका जल क्यों सूख रहा है क्योंकि ताप बढ रहा है तो सेवा सुबह नहीं बस बंद करके उड़ रही है तो जो वाटर लेवल हमारा नीचे जा रहा है इसलिए वैज्ञानिक दृष्टि से विचार कर रहे हैं आध्यात्मिक विज्ञानी भी उसी दृष्टि से विचार करें वो भी करें उपकरणों का आश्रय। लेना पड़ेगा और उस परमात्मा से प्रार्थना करें जिसके किसाने पर। उसकी मना सकती है जिसने संसार का सृजन किया उसका आशय उससे प्रार्थना करें तो इस प्रकार पर छोटे छोटे प्रतीक भी हमारे यहां गाय का रक्त यदि बहेगा धरती पर तो धरती दुखी होगी क्योंकि वो जब भगवान के पास जाना चाहती है तो अपने आपको समेटती है समेट कर गाय का रूप धारण करती है और प्रकृति। के जितने उपादान है। और प्रकृति के नियंत्रण करने वाले जितने देवी देवताएं हैं वह आध्यात्मिक शक्तियां आदि देवी शक्तियां अपने आप में समेट करके वह परमात्मा के पास प्रार्थना करने जाती संकट आ गया है तो कहते चिंता मत करो मैं तुम्हारे संकट हटने के लिए आऊंगा मैं 3 डायमेंशन सिस्टम में काम करता हूँ। मुझे 

Speaker 2  (16:29)
अवतारी बनकर। के आना पड़ा तो मैं उस रूप में बहुत लोगों को निमित्त बना दूंगा और अगर मुझे मारकर के रिमोट कंट्रोल की तरह मेरे पास उपकरण है मैं उस पर भी कर सकता हूँ बहुत समस्याओं के लिए छोटी। समस्याओं के लिए मुझे जो है आने की जरूरत नहीं जब बड़ी समस्या होती तब मैं आता हूँ तो इसलिए मैं उपकरण बना देता हूँ जो वैज्ञानिक हैं जो साइंटिस्ट हैं जो ऋषि हैं जो मुनि है मुनि माने थ्योरी लिखने वाले ऋषि माने सर्च करने वाले जो बुनी है काम करते हैं और जो ऋषि हैं वो प्रैक्टिकल काम करते हैं तो मैं उनकी अंतर्चेतना में क्षमा करके उनसे काम करवा लेता हूँ। इसलिए आप मुझसे जो प्रश्न करने आए हैं। उस दिशा में आप शोध कर रहे हैं तो आप प्रकृति के बारे में पूरी जानकारी रखिए कि प्रकृति में जो कुछ है वो हमारे अंदर है और हमारे अंदर विकार आ रहा है हमारे अंदर विचार आ रहा है तो प्रकृति की प्रेरणा से ही आ रहा है हम दुखी हो रहे हैं तो प्रकृति की प्रेरणा से हो। रहे हैं हम सुखी हो रहे हैं तो प्रकृति की प्रेरणा से सुखी हो रहे हैं और सारी मानवता अगर करा रही है तो एक मानव के रूप में प्रकृति परमात्मा नियमित बना रहा है। इस दिशा में काम करने 

Speaker 2  (17:36)
के लिए इसलिए मैं एक रिसर्चर्स की भूमिका में एक मुनि की भूमि। मैं आता हूँ और उसके विचार तो जैसे नर्मदा के किनारे रहते हैं तो नर्मदा बनती कैसे एक सात्विक विचार करें? तो नर्मदा ये कहाँ से तो भगवान शंकर तब कर रहे थे? उनका पसीना निकला पसीना बह गया अब पसीना जब वह भागा पसीना चमत्कारी होगा इसको रोकना चाहिए तो वृक्षों ने अपनी जड़ में उसको रोक लिया। और बच्चों ने जब जडे रोक दिया वृक्ष भी चेतन है प्रकृति चेतना प्रकृति नहीं है उस चैतन्य प्रकृति ने अपने पुरुष को यानी भगवान शंकर के तप को देखा और श्वेत निकला तो जितने मिररर थे जितने तत्व थे हमारे शरीर के अंदर आखिर संतान कैसी होती? 

Speaker 2  (18:23)
सारे तत्वों का जब मंथन हो जाता है निजोडकर के थोडा सा कुछ पदार्थ निकलता है जो गर्भाशय में चला जाता है। इसी को तो भगवान कृष्ण गीता में कह रहे हैं। प्रकृति मेरी योनि है मैं उसका पुरुष हूँ और मैं उसमें सृष्टि के गर्भ को उसके बीज को मैं प्रदान करता हूँ और प्रकृति उसका संयोजन करके यह संसार को प्रकट कर देती है तो हमारी प्रकृति भी तो यही काम कर रही है ना? हमारी इच्छा शक्ति हमारी इच्छा शक्ति के साथ दो तत्वों का मिलन सजाती जाति सम्मेलन और उसके बाद फिर हमारे मन में पैदा होना ईश्वर की इच्छा होती हमारी वासना जाती है तो हम वही तो काम करते। हैं जो परमात्मा प्रकृति के साथ कर रहा है तो हमारी तैयारी आती है जीव की बनाई हुई सृष्टि। एक जीव का बनाया हुआ संसार एक ईश्वर का बनाया हुआ संसार। अब इसको आप गहराई से समझ लेंगे तो आध्यात्मिक और विज्ञान का दोनों का सम्मिश्रण हो जाएगा। दोनों सोच अलग-अलग है शब्दावली अलग-अलग है पारिभाषिक शब्दावली अलग-अलग है टेक्निकल शब्दावली अलग-अलग है कंप्यूटर की भाषा का जो निर्माण हो रहा है उसकी शब्दावली अलग-अलग है एक ड्राइवर मोटर ड्राइवर गाड़ी चलाता तो उसकी उसकी टेक्निकल शब्दावली अलग होती 

Speaker 2  (19:34)
है तो इन शब्दावलियों का समावेश करते हुए हमको विज्ञान में और धर्म में और अध्यात्म में समन्वय बना लेना चाहिए और समन्वय बनाकर के इस विषय को प्रकृति अपना काम कर रही है प्रकृति आपको प्रेरणा। दे रही है। प्रकृति के लिए आप काम करें। इसलिए हम एक-दूसरे के अनुरूप एक-दूसरे के अनुकूल हैं और इसलिए श्रीमद्भगवत गीता में भी सारे सूत्र मिलते युक्ता। हार विहार युक्त चेष्टा युक्त टेक्निकल शब्द योग दे दिया। इसका नाम हमेशा दुख हटाने का कारण इसलिए बन जाए और योगी बनकर के प्रकृति के रक्षण का काम करें तो कैसे करें तो हमारा आहार शुद्ध होना चाहिए युक्ता के आयुक्त हारने? 

Speaker 2  (20:19)
हर प्राणी के लिए प्रकृति ने आहार सुनिश्चित कर दी है। अगर शेर को मांसाहारी बना दिया है तो मनुष्य को मांसाहारी नहीं बनाया। मनुष्य की प्रकृति मांसाहारी नहीं है वह भले ही मांस खाने लग जाए हमारे यहां नाखून इतने बडे हैं या सके शेर को वैसा स्वरूप दिया नाखूनों को पैदा करना उसको स्वभाव में दे दिया लेकिन मनुष्य जब पशुओं का आचरण करने लग जाता है जो मनुष्य आचरण में आचरण नहीं कहा जा सकता तब जाकर के विकृतियां आने लग जाती है इसलिए हम। आहार सुनिश्चित है सुनिश्चित आहार करिए फिर सुनिश्चित बिहार करें आप ऐसी जगह पर मत विचरण करें जहाँ आपके जीवन को खतरा है ऐसी जगह पर ऐसी प्रकृति के निकट जाए जहाँ वो हवा आपको मिलती रहे ये जो पेड पौधे हम लगाने की बात करते हैं ये क्या है यह प्रकृति के ये पर्यावरण के फेफड़े हैं ये। ऑक्सीजन ग्रहण करते हैं और आक्सीजन ग्रहण करके इसको छोड़ते हैं हमारी कार्बन डाई ऑक्साइड उनके लिए ऑक्सीजन शक्ति कोई चीज़ किसी के लिए उपयोगी है तो किसी के लिए अनुपयोगी हमारे लिए हमारा खाया हुआ निकलता है वह हमारे लिए उपयोगी नहीं है लेकिन वह किसी के लिए तो उपयोगी है तो सब एक-दूसरे। के साथ बंधे हुए हैं। इसलिए 

Speaker 2  (21:32)
उसको हम कहते हैं कोशिश को सिस्टम। साइंटिस्ट भाषा साइंटिस्क भाषा को बनाए रखने के लिए हमको सारे प्रयास मनुष्य को करना चाहिए कि मनुष्य अपने साधन ढूंढ रहा है तो हम युक्त आहार युक्त बिहार और युक्त चेस्टर से कर्म हम अपने कर्म में युक्त चेष्टा करें हम वही करें तो हमारे लिए जरूरी पत्नी के साथ भी। बच्चा पैदा कर सकते हैं लेकिन शास्त्र नहीं है प्रकृति इसका पूर्व का समर्थन नहीं करते। संतान तो हो जाएगी क्योंकि प्रोसेस वही है अपनी पत्नी के साथ। बैठेंगे उठेंगे समाज मान्यता देगा आपका मन मान्यता देगा आपकी प्रकृति भी आपकी सहायता बनेगी और आपसे बलिष्ठ आपसे ज्यादा होशियार संतान होगी लेकिन आप किसी और के साथ भी विचार कर बैठेंगे तो संतान तो हो जाएगी आपकी लेकिन आप अपराध बोध से ग्रसित रहेंगे। मैंने इसके साथ ऐसा कर्म किया था और ये रिएक्ट। हुआ था तो इसका परिणाम तो यही है लेकिन आप उसको मानसिक कैसे स्वीकृति देंगे? 

Speaker 2  (22:29)
आप अपने कुटुंब के साथ कबीले के साथ परिवार के साथ उसको सामाजिक मान्यता ही नहीं मिलेगी या मिलेगी तो वर्ण संस्कृति मान्यता मिलेगी यही तो कह रहा है कि युद्ध में मारे जाएंगे हमारे कुल की महिलाएं विधवा हो जाएंगी फिर एक-दूसरे। के साथ बैठेंगे जो संतान होगी संतान होगी वो हमारी खानदानी कौटुमिक संतान नहीं होगी और इसके कारण विचार। विचार से समाज को बचाना और दुष्प्रवृत्तियां भी प्रकृति के साथ विचार है। हम गाय को दो है हम तो करें गाय का शोषण न करें मार्ग खा जाते हैं। गाय को अरे दूध देने के लिए मातृवत भाव से खडी है तो इनका सबका संतुलन यदि बनता है तो साइंस अपनी दिशा में सुन रहे हैं अपनी भाषा में सोच रहा है। अपने उपकरणों का सहारा ले रहा है हम भी उपकरणों का सहारा लेते। अब आपको बताते हैं नई बात शायद बहुत कम लोग बोल पाते होंगे आप यांत्रिक प्रयोगशाला में आने के पहले किस प्रयोगशाला में बौद्धिक प्रयोगशाला में होते हैं? 

Speaker 2  (23:26)
मन की प्रयोगशाला में होते हैं तो सारे प्रयोग पहले कल्पना। एक नक्शा निवेश एक आर्किटेक्ट जब एक भूखंड दिखा दिया जाता है उसकी टोपोग्राफ में ले लेता है जमीन का नक्शा ले लेता है तो आपके देश में हमको भव्य भवन बनाना है इतना इसका दायरा है पहले उसको नापता है उसकी भौगोलिक स्थिति देखता है उसकी ऊंचाई देखता है उसकी गहराई देखता उसकी लंबाई देखता। उसका सा समतलीकरण देखता है उसके बाद फिर वह अपने दिमाग में नक्शा बनाता है। बैठक अपनी बौद्धिक प्रयोगशाला में है कि नहीं वो जो कुछ उसने सीखा है तो पहले बौद्धिक प्रयोगशाला में जाता है वहां खांचा खींचता है फिर तूलिका उठाता है कागज में उसके रेखाचित्र बनाता है उसका ब्लू प्रिंट तैयार करता है। उसके बाद कहता है कि यहाँ ये होगा यहाँ ये होगा यही रचना होगी तो प्रकृति का। जो पुरुष है उसने भी तो कोई कल्पना की होगी न कि मेरा संसार कैसा बचेगा किस प्रकार की तोह सृष्टि अनसाइंटिफिक नहीं है मैं यह बताना चाह रहा हूं तो एक नक्शा नदी अपनी बौद्धिक प्रयोगशाला में सब खाका खींच करके फिर आपको समझाता है फिर कारीगरों को लेकर के अपने विशेषज्ञों को भेजता। है और उसके बाद फिर उसका रंगत करना कहते 

Speaker 2  (24:37)
रंगत करते हैं धीरे धीरे आकार लेने लगता है एक खडा हो जाता है तो हमारा कहना युक्त कर्म। ये गीता कहेंगे अपने कर्मों में युक्त कर्म करो गलत निर्माण मत करवा दो जैसे प्रकृति ने संरचना की है परिवर्तन प्रकृति का स्वभाव है तो कभी कोई पुल गिर जाता है तो कभी नीचे जमीन तक जाती है कभी भूकंप आ जाते कभी ज्वालामुखी फट जाते यह प्रकृति का नेचुरल प्रोसेस है और इसके कारण भी परिवर्तन होते हैं। तो इसलिए आज के वैज्ञानिकों को चिंता कर रहे हैं पर्यावरण के संरक्षण की चिंता कर रहे हैं। पर्यावरण के जितने उपकरण है पर्यावरण के जितने साधन हैं जैसे पानी पर्यावरण का हिस्सा है अगर धरती में पानी की मात्रा कम होने लग जाएगी। आज आपको पानी चाहिए और जितना पानी चाहिए उसका अभी हमारे पास मतलब 4% कुल पेयजल है धरती में और आवश्यकता 40% की है कहां से आएगा तो आप फिर उसका अपने ढंग से तैयार करोगे। इसलिए पेयजल को बचाना नदियों का योग गहरीकरण हैं उनका सफाई निर्मलता बनाए रखना हमारे पास पानी बहुत समुद्र में। इतना पानी है परंतु पी सकते हैं कि खारे पानी करती है लेकिन उसको प्रोसेस में ढाल करके और आज खाड़ी देशों ने भी उस पानी को मीठा बनाने का 

Speaker 2  (25:53)
प्रयास करना शुरू कर दिया तो वैज्ञानिक अपने ढंग से अपनी सोच से काम करता है और आध्यात्मिक विज्ञान भी इसी बात की हमको प्रेरणा देता है बिना। आध्यात्म के सहारा लिए भौतिक विज्ञान कभी खड़ा नहीं हो सकता आज अमेरिका के सैकड़ों वैज्ञानिक मिलकर के अपने विज्ञान हाल में यह घोषणा कर रहे हैं कि हमने दृष्टि से। कर लिया लेकिन ये सारे संसार को चलाता कौन है? उसकी खोज उसी को हिंदुस्तान में इंडिया में गॉड कहते हैं और उस गॉड की उत्पत्ति कैसे होती है? हम अब उस गॉड की खोज में हमको मिल गया वो कॉल। अब उनको मिला तो कहां मिला? 

Speaker 2  (26:28)
बोले हमको इस प्रकृति के मध्य में अंतरिक्ष में एक छोटा सा पार्टिकल मिला उसी को हमने गॉड पार्टिकल कहा है वो वैज्ञानिक अभी पार्टिकल तक पहुंचे रहलाद को मिले 9 वर्ष में नरसिंह भगवान ध्रुव को मिले 4 वर्ष में नारायण भगवान ऋषि महर्षियों को अनेक। लोगों को नचिकेता सीधे सीधे यमराज के पास पहुंच गया अब यह कहानी कपूर कल्पित रख सकती है आज के साइंटिस्क को अविश्वसनीय कह सकते हैं लेकिन क्या तुम कल्पना कर सकते हो ऐसी इन कल्पनाओं के माध्यम से प्रतीकों के माध्यम से हम अपने आध्यात्मिक और तुम्हारे भौतिक विज्ञान। को भी सिद्ध करने का सामर्थ्य रखते। इसलिए विज्ञान और अध्यात्म एक-दूसरे के पूरक हैं। विरोधी नहीं है अध्यात्म अपने ढंग से सोचता है वही सोचता है निष्कर्ष में दोनों एक जगह पहुंचती। ठीक है और अंत में हमारा आध्यात्मिक क्या कहता वयम सर्वे? 

Speaker 2  (27:19)
मृतक से पुत्र आपने मूल प्रश्न उठाया कि प्रयागराज से क्या ऐसा संदेश बन रहा बन रहा है? आप गंगा यमुना की धारा में स्नान कर रहे हैं और स्नान करके अपने शरीर की शुद्धि मान रहे हैं लेकिन मन की प्रसन्नता भी तो हो रही संबंधी तो आपका प्रसन्न हो रहा है इसलिए कि मन विचारों से हट गया है आप निष्पाप होकर निर्विकार हो गए तो आप यहां से निष्पाप होकर के जा रहे हैं और फिर अनुभव भी कर रहे हैं क्योंकि हमारे सूत्र बोल रहे हैं सर्वे अमृत पुत्र हम सब। परमात्मा की संतान है यह अनुभूति हमको त्रिवेणी स्नान करने से तीर्थराज प्रयाग में आने से और आज की आधुनिक भाषा में बोलो तो जिससे खेमे बने हुए हैं यहाँ जितने पंडाल बने हुए यह सब हमारी प्रयोगशालाएं हैं और इसमें वर्कशॉप चल रही है मनुष्य मात्र की सनातन। धर्मावलंबियों की वर्कशाप है तो कोई वैष्णव को कोई गणपति आई तो कोई अनुमति कोई भगवती आई है और इस वर्ष। मैं अपने जीवन मूल्यों को अद्यतन कर रहे हैं आप क्रेडेट कर रहे हैं मैं हिंदी में बोलता हूं अंग्रेजी बोल लेता हूँ अपडेटेड भारतीय जीवन मूल्य वर्षों में अपडेटेड होते रहते पहले तो भारत की भौगोलिक सीमाओं में सिमटे थे लेकिन जैसे जैसे 

Speaker 2  (28:42)
नई नई दुनिया की खोज होने लगी पृथ्वी ब्रह्मांड की खोज हुई संसाधन। वैसे बनने लगे भौतिक संसाधन तो अब दुनिया हमारे लिए बहुत छोटी हो गई। हम 20 घंटे में कहीं भी दुनिया के किसी भी कोने में पहुंच जाते हैं लोग हमारे आ जाते हैं पहले पहले में करते थे। युग में 129 देश के सारे लोग धार्मिक आधार पर जीवन जीने जी आधार पर जीवन का मैनेजमेंट देखने आए कि इतने सारे लोग इकट्ठे होते 10000000 लोग मारते 40000000 लोग। मानते रहे हैं। इनका मैनेजमेंट रुकने का कैसा होगा? आवासीय मैनेजमेंट कैसा होगा? एक्मूडेशन, क्या होगा इनका प्रेस के साथ फ़ूड मैनेजमेंट क्या होगा 

Speaker 2  (29:44)
मैनेजमेंट हेल्थ मैनेजमेंट में एक छोटी सी घटना होगी इतने बड़े समूह के बीच में 2 450 लोग जो हैं वो घायल हो गए जब एंबुलेंस पहुंच गया उन्होंने अपना काम किया क्या हो गया अस्पताल तैयार है अस्पतालों में उनका उपचार जो विचार या सावधानी बचाव कर पाए याग्नि देवता उपस्थित हो गए वायु देवता उपस्थित हो गए। यम देवता उपस्थित होगे तो अपने अपने स्वभाव के अनुरूप उन्होंने भी काम कर दिया। 

Speaker 2  (30:24)
मंत्रों का मोहत्यार करते आएगा। एक गाने बजाने वाला आएगा तो जांच लेकर हारमोनियम लेकर पेटीवाजा लेकर एक मदारी आएगा तो अपने अपने ढंग से अपने अपने भाव से लोग यहां पर आए और यहां से कुछ लेकर जा रहे हैं। हमारा अध्यात्म और विज्ञान मैं समझता हूँ कि आपके प्रश्न का समझौते हैं आप अपनी टीसी तैयार कर लीजिए? क्या वहां गए थे एक महात्मा जी मिले थे नाम था स्वामी अखिलेश्वरानंद गिरी उनसे अपने प्रश्न किया तो उन्होंने पर्यावरण के महत्व को समझाया प्रकृति की संरचना को समझाया ईश्वर क्या होता है? प्रकृति, क्या होती है 

Speaker 2  (31:19)
पानी के हवाले कर दी जाएगी के हवाले कर दिए जाएंगे तो जीवन? शरीर का लेकिन आत्मा है और अमर है यह ज्ञान पूरी दुनिया में भारत की धरती से जाता है इसलिए हम इनसाइंटिफिक नहीं है सनातन धर्म हमारी जीवनशैली इनसाइंटिफिक नहीं है देश कार्य परिस्थिति के अनुसार सभ्यताएं निर्माण लेती है लेकिन संस्कृति देशकाल परिस्थिति से ऊपर होती है संस्कृति सबके लिए। किरंतर है संस्कृति सबके लिए एक है लेकिन सिविलाइजेशन जो है सब जगह की उत्तरी ध्रुव का आदमी दक्षिणी ध्रुव में नहीं रह सकता दक्षिणी उत्तरी ध्रुव नहीं रह सकता। अमेरिका की जीवनशैली भारत से भारत की भोजन करते तो। वो जरा जरा जो चीज़ चाटते हैं तो उनका मन नहीं निकलता वो चिड़कते इतने कपड़े से हिसाब कर लेते और पानी की जरूरत उनको भी पड़ती है तो ये सब चीजें देशकाल परिस्थिति के आधार पर बनती है सभ्यता जो होती है वह बुद्धि का आशय लेके चलते हैं बुद्धि देशकाल परिस्थिति के अनुसार। होती है लेकिन अनुभव के आधार पर जो है वो संस्कृति होती है संस्कृति अनुभव के आधार पर चलती है सभ्यता बुद्धि के अनुसार बुद्धि पलट जाती है यहाँ की बुद्धि वहां बदल जाती है वहां की बुद्धि क्योंकि बुद्धि देशकाल 

Speaker 2  (32:34)
परिस्थिति के आधार पर प्रभावित होती है लेकिन अनुभव देशकाल से ऊपर उठकर के सार्वत्रिक होती है सार्वजनिक होती है सब जगह होती है। इसलिए धर्म और आध्यात्मिक और विज्ञान आध्यात्मिक विज्ञान है और धर्म में भी विज्ञान है लेकिन हम उसको दो हिस्से में करके हम उसको विज्ञान मान करके और लोगों को समझाते हैं बिल्कुल ये कुंभ इसीलिए। 

Speaker 1  (33:01)
कुछ फॉलो क्वेश्चन एक तो मैं आपसे पूछना चाहूंगा पहले हमारा जैसे कि अभी आपने जो इतना डिटेल और बहुत ही बेहतरीन तरीके से आपने जो विश्लेषण दिया मैं गंगा माता की बात करना चाहता हूँ। अभी कुछ दिन पहले एक इंटरनेशनल जर्नल में एक रिसर्च पेपर पब्लिश हुआ जिसका कहना है कि गंगा माता इज़। बायोलॉजिकली डेट इसका अर्थ उन्होंने क्या दिया साइंटिफिक प्रूफ कह दिया कि उसमें मल मूत्र की इतनी ज्यादा क्वांटिटी है। मिकल ने बाकी एंट्स की इतनी ज्यादा क्वांटिटी इसके अलावा जो उसके अंदर जू प्लांकटन हाइड्रोप्लांटन जो सूक्ष्म जीव से लेकर के उसके अंदर जो पेड़ पौधे और जानवर होने चाहिए उनकी मात्रा इतनी सफिशिएंट नहीं है कि उसको जीवंत माना जाए तो ये तो साइंटिफिक कम्युनिटी ने अपना। कुछ प्रेजेंट कर दिया लेकिन एक दूसरी ओर में दूसरा चीज़ देखो तो महाकुंभ में हो सकता है। यहां पर आकर स्नान करेंगे। आदिकाल से आज तक वो जो क्या बोलना चाहिए? 

Speaker 1  (33:58)
धर्म के प्रति या गंगा माता के प्रति भक्ति है बड़ी है घटी नहीं है तो ये दोनों विपरीत बातों को किस प्रकार आप देखते हैं? 

Speaker 2  (34:10)
गंगा के बारे में जब शास्त्रीय विश्लेषण होता है आध्यात्मिक विश्लेषण होता है तो गंगा के दो स्वरूप 3 डाइमेंशन को समझिए। हमारे 3 डाइमेंशन सिस्टम में आध्यात्मिक चिंतन करता है। प्रेरणा तो एक होती है हमारी सत्ता जो शाश्वत है वह परिवर्तनीय है दूसरा परिवर्तनशील सप्ताह होती है उसमें सत्य विद्यमान होता है और तीसरा व्यवहार में आने वाली होता है। जब हम गंगा को देखते हैं तो उसको हम आध्यात्मिक सत्ता के रूप में देखते हैं। दूसरा मुझे एक कहीं दैवी शक्ति के रूप में दैविक शब्द के रूप में हम उसको माँ मानते हैं उसका एक देवी स्वरूप ऐसे जैसे मैं अपनी माँ को देखता हूं और तीसरा स्वरूप उसके व्यवहार का होता है कि उसकी जल का पान करते हैं हम उसके जल में स्नान करते हैं हम उसके जल में। पवित्रता देखते हैं। तो हमेशा किसी भी शरीर तक लिए तो गंगा है आप गंगा का प्रश्न करें भारत की किसी भी सरलता के दो स्वरूप होते हैं एक उसमें होता है निर्मलता स्वच्छता और एक कुत्ता है उसका भाई शुरू बाय। कलेवर भाई के कलेवर मनुष्य की असावधानी के कारण मल मूत्र विसर्जन। से बाय कलेवर बाह्य आवरण जो है उसका प्रदूषण युक्त दिखता है लेकिन उसके आंतरिक गुण 

Speaker 2  (35:24)
को तो आपने देखा ही नहीं। गंगा का आंतरिक गुण है पवित्रता इसलिए हम पवित्रता के साथ आए लेकिन हमारे कर्तव्य बनता है कि गंगा में जो विसर्जन हो रहा है जो गंदगी आ रही है उस गंदगी का निवारण भी हमें गंदगी कहाँ से रही है हमारी मूर्खता के कारण हमारी के कारण हमारी सावधानी के कारण हमारे व्यवहार के कारण आ। रही है इसलिए उस प्रदूषण को हटाना अगर साइंटिफिक कम्युनिटी कह रही है जो साइंस से जुड़े हुए लोग हैं अगर वह कहें तो ऊपर ऊपर का विश्लेषण कर रहे गंगा की पवित्रता को किसी भी काल में कोई चुनौती नहीं दी गई है इसलिए हम। पवित्र स्वरूप के पास आए हैं हाँ उसके कलेवर में जहाँ जहाँ प्रदूषण आया है हम उसको छोड कर के हम जो गैर प्रदूषित जल है उस जल के निकट जाकर स्नान करते हैं मन पवित्र होता है तन पवित्र होता है हमारे अंग पानी से शुद्ध होते हैं लेकिन हमारा मन उसकी निर्मलता से शुद्ध होता है। इसको ध्यान में रखना होगा। भारत की किसी भी इसलिए वैज्ञानिक सोच अपनी जगह पर है। अध्यात्म का चिंतन अपनी? 

Speaker 2  (36:31)
पढ़ा हम वैज्ञानिकों को इस सोच का समर्थन करते हैं एनजीटी ने जो कहा है कि भारत की नदियों को स्वच्छ रखने के लिए उनके किनारे हमको पेड़ पौधे लगाने चाहिए और हमें मूत्र का विसर्जन वहां नहीं करना चाहिए इसलिए आपने इस प्रयाग में देखा होगा लाखों की संख्या में शौचालय बनाए गए हैं हमने। प्रश्न आपसे 20 साल पहले अपने गुरु जी से उठाया था। हम गंगा प्रदूषित हो रही है हम यहां गंदगी कर रहे हैं हमारी जो मजबूत है वो तो यहीं पर रेत में दफना दिया गया तो क्या इससे गंगा में प्रदूषण हमने फैला रहे हैं? गुरु जी ने इसका बडा सुंदर उत्तर दिया था प्रश्न बिल्कुल ठीक है तुम्हारा हम भी तैयार शंकराचार होकर के इसमें कर रहे हैं। हम भी तो मजबूत विसर्जन करें लेकिन प्रकृति के प्रोसेस को भी ध्यान में रखना पड़ेगा जब हम गंगा की बालिका में। गहराई में बल को विसर्जित करके उसको बंद कर देते हैं तो मन में ही विशेषता है गहराई को समझ नहीं पाते मन में ही विशेषता होती उसमें कीडा पैदा हो जाता है उसमें जीव आ जाता है उसमें जीवन आ जाता है और उसके प्रदूषण का भक्षण करके और जो अवशिष्ट रह जाता है वह यहीं। छोड़ जाता है सूर्य के ताप से वो ध्वस्त होकर के 

Speaker 2  (37:39)
जब गंगाजी में बरसात के मौसम में बाढ आती है वह बाहर ले जाकर समुद्र में दे देता है समुद्र में बढ़ा रहता है एक तेज रहता है समुद्र में उसको क्योरिफाई करके और कभी डीजल में परिवर्तित कर देता है कि पेट्रोल में परिवर्तित। करें। पेट्रोलियम पदार्थ और डीजनिंग करना यह समुद्र का काम है तो साइंटिफिक कहां हुई सब कुछ साइंटिफिक प्रोसेस से हो रहा है ना? इस रचना को भी ध्यान में रखना चाहिए। बात जो उत्तर मूल रूप से हमारा है कि गंगा प्रदूषित हो रही है उसमें दो मत नहीं मलमूत्र का विसर्जन मनुष्य करता है इसलिए मनुष्य ने चेतना वैज्ञानिक और हम सब मिलकर के जागृत करें गंगा में जाकर और भी फेंके हम कोई ऐसी शिष्ट पदार्थ भेजें जिससे उसका प्रदूषित हो जाए और उसको देख करके हम उसके आंतरिक गुण से भी वंचित हो जाए गंगा का तो इतना महत्व है हमारे शास्त्रों। में क्या? 

Speaker 2  (38:33)
कहीं भी आए और चेन्नई में बैठे बैठे आप गंगा गंगा गंगा रखेंगे तो गंगा अपना अपनी स्वच्छता अपनी दिव्यता अपनी भव्यता और अपनी निर्मलता वो वहां पहुंचा देगी। हाँ वैज्ञानिक प्रोसेस की दृष्टि से देखेंगे आप तो गंगा में नदियों में उसके निरंतर प्रवाह चलना उसकी निर्मलता के लिए बहुत बडा कारण है उसका। अविरल प्रवाह अवरुद्ध न हो यह प्रयास भौतिक दृष्टि से हमको आपको सबको करते रहेंगे। 

Speaker 1  (39:02)
एक चीज़ मैं आपकुंभ मेले के बारे में आपसे जानना चाहता हूं आप बहुत करीब साल से कइयों को मेरा अटेंड कर चुके होंगे। आप अपने गुरुजनों से बाकी लोगों से भी और सुनते होंगे। आदिम काल के कुंभ मेले के बारे में और आज हम 2025 में अब कुंभ मिले के परिपेक्ष्य को परिशिष्टकों किस प्रकार परिवर्तित होते हुए देखें? उस दिन से। 

Speaker 2  (39:24)
देखिए देश काल में फिर आपने कहा तो पहले इसका उत्तर आपको दे दिया क्योंकि उद्भूत हो गया है प्रश्न तो ये बता देता हूँ आपको ध्यान में देता हूँ हम अत्यंत प्राचीन और पुरातन अपनी सभ्यताओं को अपनी जीवनशैली को अपनी संस्कृति को मानते चले आ रहे हैं और जब योग परिवर्तन होता है तो हर युग अपने। समय में आधुनिक होता है। आधुनिक युग अपनी अधिक उपलब्धियों के साथ-साथ साथ समसामयिक बना रहता है। इसलिए इसको हम परिवर्तनीय मान रहे हैं लेकिन जो परिवर्तन आया है उस परिवर्तन के साथ हम अपने आप को आधुनिक भी मानते हैं हम अगर परंपरावादी है तो आधुनिक वादी भी है और जो भौतिक संसाधन विकसित हो गए मनुष्य के पुरुषार्थ के द्वारा मनुष्य के प्रयत्न के द्वारा प्रयत्न ही पुरुषार्थ है तो उसको। स्वीकार करते हैं पहले कठपुतली में पर्ल कुटीर में आते थे। साधु संत महात्मा और छोडकर चले जाते थे। बाद में लाल लोग होते थे लोग होते का उपयोग कर लेते थे। बाद में कुटीर में परिवर्तित हो बनने लगे दरवाजा टेंट बनने लगे। भीड़ के साथ-साथ उपलब्धियां भी नहीं नहीं आने लगी। उसके बाद योग परिवर्तन हुआ आज इस युग में हम आ गए हैं। इस युग में बडे बडे भवन जैसे बनने लगे 

Speaker 2  (40:39)
लेकिन उसके लिए भी हमको कास्ट का ही सहारा लेना पड़ता फ्लाईओवर। वगैरह आगे इनका उपयोग करने लगे हम सीट से उस से अपना बचाव भी करते गंगा की ठंडी बालुका में आदमी आएगा बेहोश हो जाएगा। यहाँ आएगा बीमार हो जाएगा तो उस दृष्टि से किसी को हेल्थ मैनेजमेंट कहते हैं। उस दृष्टि से हमने यहां बड़े बड़े लकड़ी के पटने बिछाना शुरू कर दिया कि वह सीट नीचे चला जाएगा। ऊपर लकड़ी का आवरण होगा। हम उसके ऊपर अपने कुछ चीजें बिठाएंगे। पहले, क्या होता? 

Speaker 1  (41:12)
मैसेज में ऑयल का इस्तेमाल। 

Speaker 2  (41:14)
देख रहे हैं जी बिल्कुल बिछा लेते हैं उसमें जो ग्रीष्म होती है उसमें हमारे शरीर का ताप और उसका ताप मिल करके हमको शीत से बचाता है तो ये आधुनिक उपकरण आने लगे और उसका हमने उसे अपने देश काल परिस्थिति के अनुसार और आज के आधुनिक के अनुसार उसको स्वीकार कर लिया लेकिन जीवन मूल्यों के साथ नहीं। किया हम यहाँ शुद्ध साथी आहार लेते हैं। हम भगवान का जप करते हैं ध्यान करते हैं या जो पारंपरिक देवी देवता यहां विराजमान हैं। गंगा नदी है यमुना नदी सरस्वती नदी है। अपने महापुरुषों से हमने इन नदियों के बारे में सुना है। अगर मुझे दार्शनिक लहजे में कहना पड़े दार्शनिक भाषा में कहना पडे तो मैं आध्यात्मिक भाषा में कह सकता हूं गंगा गंगा उसे ब्रह्मद्रवा माना गया वह ब्रह्मत्रवाह है यमुना प्रेम है और सरस्वती जो है ज्ञान विज्ञान की अधिष्ठात्री है। इसलिए हम गंगा के साथ साइंटिफिक नहीं है। यमुना के साथ साइंटिफिक नहीं है हमारा मनोविज्ञान जुड़ा हुआ है। यमुना के साथ कभी यमुना के किनारे भगवान कृष्ण ने की है। वो प्रेम का संदेश दे रही है यमुना के बिना प्रेम के विश्व प्रेम की भावना यहाँ से लेकर के जाओ हम सबसे प्यार करते हैं हम किसी 

Speaker 2  (42:30)
से भेदभाव नहीं करते कोई व्यक्ति कहीं से आया पर्सनल बाजील से कुछ समूह हमारे यहाँ आया था हमने उनको भोजन कराया उन्हें कौन हम मेरे भगवान है काहे के हैं। मैंने बताया क्रिस्टल है कैसे बनता है हमने हिमालय में हजारों करोड़ों वर्ष तक जो बर्फ जमा रहता है वह पत्थर में परिवर्तित हो जाता है। ये वही हिमालय का पत्थर पानी का है और इसको फिर कार्ड करके। शिवलिंग बनाया गया हमने अपने गुरु जी की स्थापना कर दी कि गुरु जी चले गए अब गुरु सत्ता तो अमर है गुरु का शरीर चला गया उस सत्ता को हमने इसमें विद्यमान कर दिया मेरे गुरु इसमें सूक्ष्म रूप से विराजमान है और वो मेरी बात सुन रहे हैं और मैं उनकी आराधना कर रहा हूँ बोले हम कैच कर। सकते हैं इसको पुर्तगाली भाषा बोलते हैं। उन्होंने निकाला कंप्यूटर से तत्काल भाषा। हम बात कोशिश की बनाने के लिए नहीं बन पाया पर भाव समझ गए। जब टच करने लगे तो लेने लगे हम लोग शिवलिंग को नहीं कोई बात नहीं अगर आप लगा रहे तो स्नान कराकर भगवान को शुद्ध कर देंगे। शंकर जी की प्यार किया का संदेश हमारे का संदेश है प्रेम का संदेश दे रहे हैं तो उनके साथ कोई नहीं करते हो सकता है लेकिन संस्कृति के कारण 

Speaker 2  (43:46)
मूल भावना के कारण। जब हम वसुदेव कुटुंबकम कहते हैं हमारे अपने आप ही बंधु आए तो उनके अंदर भी तो लाइट विद्यमान है जो हमारे अंदर विद्यमान है। इस प्रकार से उस रूप में कोई परिवर्तन नहीं आया हम चिंता जब वही कर रहे हैं माला वही इलेक्ट्रॉनिक मालाएं चलने लगी संख्या के लिए होता है वो संगणक कर देता है कि हमने कितना जब कर लिया जब तो मन से चल रहा है स्वास्थ्य चल रहा है तो हमारी साधना के प्रोसेस है इसलिए धर्म और अध्यात्म। में धर्म अध्यात्म और विज्ञान। इनका समन्वय भारतीय संस्कृति में पल पल पर अनुशोध है इसलिए हम विज्ञान के विरोधी नहीं है भौतिक विज्ञान की कुछ बातें हम मानते हैं लेकिन कोई बातें हम उनकी अनदेखी कर देते हैं कि ये सब नहीं हमारे यहाँ पानी से हम सोच करके धोते हैं अगर हम 1000000000 देशों में चले जाया तो पानी नहीं होता तो। वही पत्थर से लगा लगा करके और हम अमेरिका आदमी चले जाते तो वह टिशू पेपर होता है लेकिन फिर भी हम भारतीय हम अपने स्वभाव को नहीं बदलते तो हम पानी का सहारा लेकर के उसी पेपर को रूमाल बना देते और पोर्ट 5 साफ कर लेते हैं पानी से शुद्धि होती है। देश काल संस्थान। 

Speaker 1  (44:57)
बहुत सारा समय लिया बस दो प्रश्न और हैं क्योंकि बहुत आपने काफी समय दे दिया महाराजा एक तो ये कि आपकी आश्रम के माध्यम से आपके आशीर्वाद के माध्यम से हम जैसे पेड़ पौधों को बचाने के लिए पर्यावरण को बचाने के लिए और जो दुनिया में विकृतियां आ रही हैं उनको ठीक करने के लिए किस प्रकार हम? प्रयास। 

Speaker 2  (45:22)
हम प्रयास रहते हैं स्वयं पेड लगाते हरियाली अमावस्या हमारे यहां आती है श्रावण के महीने में वो तो प्रकृति का महोत्सव है ना? हमने मध्यप्रदेश में जहां रहते हमने पूरे भारत को संदेश दिया है हमारे जो वीडियो वगैरह हैं जो हमारे इलेक्ट्रॉनिक मीडिया हमारा जो सोशल मीडिया हम संदेश देना प्रारंभ कर देते हैं। कि 5 5 पौधे अपने हाथ से लगाइए। अपनी भूमि पर लगाइए आपके पास भूमि नहीं तो पड़ोसी से अनुरोध करके उसकी भूमि पर लगाई पड़ोसी फलदार वृक्ष लगाने के लिए तैयार हो जाता है। आज लगाएगा तो 15 साल बाद फल आएंगे। उसमें आजकल तो ऐसे ऐसे पौधे तैयार हो गए साइंटिफिक ढंग से कि 5 साल में पौधे फल देने लगे और खासतौर से औषधीय वृक्ष लगाए जिनमें फल नहीं मिलता लेकिन औषधि गुण होते हैं उन पेड पौधों की प्रजाति लुप्त न होने पाए तो पर्यावरण संरक्षण के लिए हम यह संदेश देते हैं अपने आश्रम के माध्यम से एक गोपाल का त्यौहार आता है। जो कार्तिक मास में आता तो गाय का पूजन करें। यही गाय प्रकृति की संरक्षिका है प्रकृति के साथ गाय का सीधा संबंध है उसके कारण गिनी बुक में दर्ज हैं। गाय के बारे में इतना शोध हमने किया जो प्रकृति से जुड़ती है 

Speaker 2  (46:54)
पर्यावरण से जुड़ती है इतना साइंटिफिक ढंग से हमें बताने की कोशिश की आध्यात्मिक विज्ञान के द्वारा बताने की कोशिश की दोनों का समन्वय बनाया है और गोरक्षण धरती पर होना चाहिए। यह कहा है हमने गोपाष्टमी के दिन गोशाला को केंद्रित कर देती गोशालाओं के आस-पास पर्यावरण संरक्षण तो हमारे यहां तो 4 5। त्यौहार आते हैं प्रकृति महोत्सव मनाते हैं अलग-अलग क्षेत्र में। पेड पौधे लगाने की प्रेरणा देते हैं फिर अपने जल को स्वच्छ रखना जल के किनारे जाना स्नान करना लेकिन जल के स्नान करने की पहले उसको प्रणाम करना यहां भी हम लोगों को बता रहे हैं। क्या त्रिवेणी में जाओ 3 सेकंड लगा आप वहां पर पहले 2nd में ऋषि परंपरा को याद करो क्योंकि वो साइंस? 

Speaker 2  (47:36)
हमारे यहाँ के साइंटिस्ट थी उनको क्या आपने इतनी बड़ी चीज़ हमको बताइए कि इसके महत्व के बारे में हम आपको प्रणाम करते हैं हम जिस परिवार खानदान के अपने पूर्वजों को याद करो एक सेकंड में अगले 2nd में अपनी गुरु परंपरा को याद करो जो हमारे घर में चलती है फिर भगवान को याद करो। भारत की धरती पर आपने हमको जन्म दिया है सनातन धर्मावलंबी माता पिता के हमारे पास? जननी आपने बनाया? उनको लगा होते जितने लगा सकते हो काम चले जाएगा और काम चल जाएगा फोटोग्राफी होती ही पिक्चर बनाए जाते थे। पहले पर्दे पर दिखाते थे इतनी तेजी के साथ फोटो उसके एक्शन की खींचते थे। वो कि 1500 फोटो आ जाती थी और जब रेल चलती तो 1 1 फोटो दिखाई पडती थी। ठीक है आपको बताओ साइंस से जोड़ा के नहीं जोड़ा। हमने रिफ्लेक्स तो होता है हमारा। इस तरह से संदेश दिया गरीबों की सेवा करो तुमने जो पुरुषार्थ से अर्जित किया है जो संसार में दीन दुखी लोग हैं जिन्होंने कभी सोना नहीं देखा तो कम से कम 1 1 तोला तो अपने घर से निकाल लो सोना और 1 1 g सोना निकाल कर के 1010 g सोना निकाल कर के उनके। छोटे छोटे लॉकेट बनाकर उनको दे दो शिव आकृति के विष्णु की आकृति बना दो बारीक 

Speaker 2  (48:54)
बारीक। हमारे गुरुजी ने छत्तीसगढ़ में बस्तर के आदिवासियों को पिछले कुंभ में जो 2016 में पढ़ा था में उन्होंने कितना सोना इकट्ठा किया था और सोना इकट्ठा करके उनको सबको गला कर छोटी छोटी गिन्निया जैसी बनाकर उसमें भगवान शंकर के क्रॉस दे रही है दुनिया भर के तो एक बार सोने का उनको शिवलिंग दे। दो सोने के संकरी बना के दे दो सोने की राम लिख के दे दो लिखे दे दो स्वस्तिक बना के दे दो कम से कम देख रहे तो हिंदू पहले से लटका हो रहा है। तो दो प्रयोजन हो गए सोना का सोना आदिवासी बहनों ने वनवासियों ने आज भी हम देखते निर्वश गया कोंडाग्राम गया और कहीं कहीं गया तो मैंने निर्वस्त्र महिला अपने जीवन में पहली बार देखी। तब लगा कि क्यों मेरे शहर की बहन के पास निकाल सारी तुम अपने पास 2244 साडी। निकालो और मैने बस्तर में भिजवाया। मैंने और इसके अलावा जिले में जमीन की गहराई में 2000 नीचे रहते हैं आदिवासी। रोशनी नहीं देखी? 

Speaker 2  (49:57)
वहां हमने मिलकर के सरकारी मशीनों के साथ बच्चों को पहली बार हमने मेरी बहन को निर्वस्त्र देखा ये फोटो आप नहीं खींचेंगे फ़ोटोग्राफ़ मेरी बहन के वस्त्र के अभाव में ऐसी आई है रहना चाहिए ईश्वर पूजन खोजते हैं कण कण में देखते हैं पत्थर में भगवान देख रहे हैं और इंसान हमारे यहाँ। नंगा घूम रहा है भगवान की उपासना हमारी गलत है यह तो हमारी संवेदनाओं का प्रतिबिंब है दिखा रहे लेकिन हम जा रहे हैं उनके पास कोई भी यहां आता है हम किसी से नहीं पूछते। तुम कौन जाति के कौन बिरादरी के कौन किस क्षेत्र के आप प्रसन्नता से एक महीने के लिए चला रहे हैं लेकिन हमें?

जनरल सेक्रेटरी चेन्नई मिशन के तो यूपी के यूपी। 

Speaker 1  (01:01)
नहीं बता जो जनरल सेक्रेटरी इंडिया के यूपी बहुत अच्छा तो सबसे पहले मैं शुरुआत ऐसे करूँगा कि जब हम अध्यात्म की बात करते हैं स्पिरिचुअलिटी की बात करते हैं और दूसरी तरफ हम सांसारिक भोग विलास और माया की बात करते हैं जिसमें मुझे गर्मी लग रही है तो शायद सांसारिक माया का हिस्सा हो। सकता है तो क्या सनातन धर्म या अध्यात्म में ये सांसारिक विषयों का उत्तर खोजना चाहिए या नहीं? आपको, क्या लगता है? 

Speaker 2  (01:32)
पाठ है सुना हमारे पाठ है सांसारिक सुख सुविधा हमारे आध्यात्म रचनातना एक पार्टी है ऐसा नहीं कि सांसारिक सुख सुविधाओं से परे होकर के उसको छोड़कर त्याग करके और हम जो अध्यात्म को प्राप्त कर लेंगे ऐसा नहीं संसार में रहते हुए संसार की सुख सुविधाओं का उपभोग करते हुए चिकन बड़े आराम से आध्यात्मिक। पुरुष बन सकते हैं। आध्यात्मिक का मतलब यह हुआ। ये हमारे अंदर ही अपनी अपना उत्थान अपनी उम्र स्व की उत्पति हम जो है किस लेवल पर आखिर भौतिक शिक्षक सुविधाओं का भोग करते करते करते-करते आदमी थक जाता है और सिख उसमें पूर्ण सुख नहीं प्राप्त कर पाता है पूर्ण आनंद नहीं प्राप्त करना थोड़े समय के लिए किसी विषय से सुख मिला और उसके बाद। उसे उसका मन हटा। दूसरे विषय की फिर ऐसे ऑब्जेक्ट से बहुत सारे विषय है संसार में विषयों से भरा हुआ है कोई बहुत बाधा नहीं लेकिन उसको समझ करके आपको लौट जाना है परमानंद सुख की प्राप्ति के लिए जो फिर सुख प्राप्त कर लेने के बाद सारे सामने दौड़ने होते हैं 

Speaker 2  (03:16)
थोड़ा सुख मिला थोड़ा सुख मिला कोई चीज़ बाद में हर। झगड़ा कितना खाओगे आप मीठा कितना रसगुल्ला खाओगे खाते खाते खाते समय ऐसा आएगा? 

Speaker 2  (03:50)
जो भी आप ले लीजिए वो भौतिक सुख जो भी हम समझते हैं कि हमें बड़ा सुख प्रदान कर रहा है वह हमारा आत्मिक सुख नहीं है।

Speaker 2  (04:58)
बहुत बहुत सारी सबसे बड़ी जो सुधार की बात है 

Speaker 2  (05:24)
कोई शौचालय नहीं कोई सुविधा उसकी नहीं जितने लोग मेले में सोचिए कितने लोग आते हैं असंख्य तरीके समझ लीजिए करोड़ों लोग वो सब ऐसी शायद जो बनी हुई है 

Speaker 2  (05:56)
आज यह बदलाव है रात को सड़क पर शहर 2019 और 2025 व्यवस्था हुई। ऐसी सुपर व्यवस्था थी जिसका कोई लिहाज नहीं एक गंदगी का नामो निशान और पर्यावरण को भी मिली। अच्छा मतलब वातावरण जो है जो है बिल्कुल एकदम। पवित्र वातावरण देखना तो सबसे बड़ा बदलाव तो यह। 

Speaker 1  (06:35)
और लोगों के मना मस्तिष्क में या लोगों का जो रुझान है वो किस प्रकार बदलते हुए आप देख रहे हैं उस समय से अभी तक। 

Speaker 2  (06:43)
बढा है पहले से लोग इस कुंभ का आकर्षण सरकार इस तरह से काम कर रही हैं कि तमाम ऐसे मतलब सुविधाओं से इसको लैस कर दी रही है न केवल साधारण लोगों बल्कि देश विदेश और विदेशी लोगों का भी सबका रुझान आकर्षण तक केंद्रीय बनाया था। सारे लोग इसलिए यहां दौड़े चले आ रहे हैं होटल फिर ऐसे। से पहले तो कोई सुविधाएं इस तरह के लिए जनरली एसिड टंट में राइटर के लोग और जो है मलते बाहर करके रोकरके शौचालय की व्यवस्था लाइट की व्यवस्था पानी की व्यवस्था शुद्ध पीने को पानी गई। गंगा भी प्रदूषित बहुत हुआ करती थी। उन दिनों 2001 में तो मैं आपको बताऊं 2013 में तो यह हाल था कि नहाने की बात जाने दो क्या मतदान? 

Speaker 2  (07:37)
गंगा का जल आश्रमुत करने लायक नहीं था तेरा लेकिन 2019 से बहुत है। मैं कोई सरकार का पक्ष नहीं हूं जिससे पक्ष में देख रहा हूं। गंगा का जल आपको घर पर गंगाजल कर रहे हैं। गोपी राय ने 2013 भी नहीं किया था। 

Speaker 1  (07:55)
और जो लोगों की ये तो हमने भौतिक की बात की लोगों की मन स्थिति किस प्रकार की है? कैसे दिखावा के लिए आना है अपनी कहानी में दाखी हल्ला हो कि मैं महाकुंभ जा के आया हूँ।

लोगों में लोगों में चेंज है लोग आकर के यहां आपके के बड़े बड़े पंडाल में जहाँ आध्यात्मिक चर्चा चल रही है जहाँ वेद और पुराण संस्कृति का गहन एक दुर्गे से प्रचार हो रहा है वहां लोग युवा भी बैठे सुन वर्षिंग करके जा रहे एक संदेश लेकर मानवता घोर मानवतावादी का संदेश यहाँ से जा। रहा है आपको बताऊं कि जाति पाठ की व्यवस्था के खिलाफ। यहां पे खुले मंच से बड़े बड़े संत महात्मा साधु जो महामंडलेश्वर जो कभी जात पात की ही बात करते उन सबमें ये चेंज आया हुआ कि वो जात पाती तो मगर धज्जियां उड़ा रहा है गुजरी आप जो तमाम जाती हैं उसको छोड़ो आप केवल और केवल सनातनी केवल। हिंदू एक जाति व्यवस्था और हमारी पहले मानव जाति और मानव जाति के बाद फिर हम हिंदू सनातनी हैं और सारे लोग समती। सभी हिन्दु ये कहने की जरूरत नहीं है कि मैं उससे हठ करके कुछ दूसरा है ही नहीं आपका बीच तनावपिल आप सनातन मुस्लिम भी हैं उनको बताता है वो भी हमारे ये सब कन्वर्टेड है यहां सारे तो सनातन का प्रचार प्रसार और भाईचारे की भावना विश्वबंधुत्व की भावना प्रेम करना लोगों। से सुंदर हम परीक्षण में कभी कभी देख रहे हैं। कई गीता पर प्रवचन कर रहे कहीं भावों पर चल

मतलब सीरियसी मैंने ऑटो पैशनस ड्राइवर्स प्रिंग किए थे। बहुत अच्छे तरीके से थोड़ा और समय लूंगा। आपका एक बहुत इंसेंटली साइंटिफिक पेपर आया विशेष गंगा माता बायोलॉजिकल डेट वुड डेनेस दे हैव सैंपल कंटेंट स्टडी किया और कुछ केमिकल पैरामीटर्स हाइड्रोप्लांट और प्लांट के सेक्टर का प्रेजेंट किया। उसके आधार पर उन्होंने क्लेम कर दिया कि उसके बिना भी 10000000 श्रद्धालु। वो, क्या चीज़ है जो मतलब हम आज के यूथ को आज की साइंटिफिक कम्युनिटी को समझा सकते हैं कि मतलब क्या उनको खींच के लेके आती है? 

Speaker 1  (07:01)
बहुत अच्छे प्रश्न पूछा है मैं भारतीय सेना में सेवा किया उत्तराखंड में उनके साथ मेरे को हरिद्वार में रहने का सौभाग्य मिला क्योंकि सेवा करने के लिए घूम रहा था तो मेरा भी प्रश्न था इतनी भारतीय लोगों को आस्था बनाती है आज क्या पानी तो है हर जगह है पानी के कई सारी चीजें तो आस्था जो है पानी? को दक्षिण में या भारतीय लोग जो है जो जो गंगा नहीं जानते हैं जो गंगा के तट पर नई वास करते हैं तो ऐसा लोग जो है जल को गंगा मानते हैं भारतीय धर्म में गंगा मानते हैं और कई सारी बच्चों का नाम जो दक्षिण में गंगा रहता है।

Speaker 1  (10:54)
बारे में जब पढ़ेगा तो शिवजी के डेटा में बंधन करते हैं कि उनके पानी जब नीचे आती है ग्लेशियर से। पूरा तबाही करके क्यों पानी का शक्ति पानी के शक्ति रहता है कि वो नीचे तक कोई रोक नहीं सकता वो भी जब ढलान में आ रही है तब जो है जो है एक अद्भुत काल्पनिक शक्ति रखता है और सेंट्रल सिटी भी लगता है। राजा भी देव। इसके कारण उनकी सेंट्रल सिटी के कारण ये सब सिद्ध हो और शूजी को प्रसन्न किया ऐसा कहते कि पानी को वह रोका फिर। ग्रू बंधन हो गई। शिवजी के मेडिकल आता हूँ तेलुगू में जो है सभी मेरा बचपन बडा है। आपने भी पढा होगा जब जल नीचे आती है उसकी उसकी जलधारा को जो है कई सारे माध्यमों से कभी उन्हें कहा होगा मुझे प्रयास पड़ा होगा। 

Speaker 2  (12:02)
हाँ सर। काफी समय हो गया तो शायद। 

Speaker 1  (12:11)
करेंगे शिवजी का जो है उसकी उसमें वो अपना वर्णन करते तो वो तो एक कवि का दिल वैसा कहता है मगर जब पानी नीचे आती है तो उसको भी एक रास्ता चाहिए पहनी गई निकलने के लिए इतनी पानी जब आएगी उसको क्या करूंगा बंगाल ही मार्ग है उत्तराखंड से लेकर बंगाल जब पानी मिलती है समुद्र में मिलने। के पहले किलोमीटर रास्ता है। कहीं कहीं जो एक क्लाइमेट एक्सपर्ट जो है इसको समझना चाहिए जब पानी को ही कोई व्यक्ति पैदा नहीं कर सकता है तो इसका जो पानी वाटर साइकिल है उसको समझना चाहिए को अध्ययन करना चाहिर को अध्ययन करना चाहिए पर्यावरण को अध्ययन करना चाहिए सभी को अध्ययन करने के बाद ही कोई भी पॉलिसी मेकिंग में डिसीजन। लेना चाहिए कहानी सुनेंगे या? 

Speaker 1  (13:24)
जिले के ऊपर भारतीय भारतीयता की परंपरागत स्तर की बनाया है कि हजारों जर्नी लाखों करोड़ों लोग यात्रा में हरिद्वारा गाँव से निकलते हैं छोटा सा पानी लेकर गाँव जाकर शिवजी को अर्पण करते हैं गंगा है गंगा माने पूजनीय है उसकी उसके बाद जीवन तो ये ये अद्भुत कहानी यह तुलना जो है। और आपको कोई भी अन्य जगह नहीं मिलता है क्योंकि गंगा को आप पूजन करिए 7 करिए गंगा के बिना आपका जल के बिना आपका जीवन नहीं है। हाँ यह बात भी सही है कि अलग-अलग अलग। 

Speaker 1  (14:26)
ठीक करने के लिए सार्वजनिक जीवन में लाने के लिए काफी प्रयास चल रही। हरिद्वार में 2 2 पर्वत दो पहाड़ी है मनसा देवी और चंडीदेवी दोनों के बीच बीचों बीच गंगा बैठी थी काफी सुबह कम हो गया। अभी काफी निजी स्तर से कहीं जो है अगर ये साइकिल ठीक नहीं करेंगे इसके ऊपर सेंटिफिक स्टडी होना बहुत जरूरी है। एक जुर्माना ऐसा नहीं आना चाहिए। दोबारा जल के बिना ये सब जगह लड़ाई हो जाए और तृतीय या चौथा युद्ध आने वाली इसके ऊपर। सभी लोगों को वापस इस अवस्था के ऊपर सेंटिफिक आधारित के ऊपर काम करना चाहिए कोई अंधविश्वास नहीं तो भारतीय का जो कोई भी चीज़ है जिसके पीछे बहुत बड़ी सहज छुपी हुई है तो साइंस को समझना चाहिए कम से कम बुद्धिजीवे लोग जो है इसके ऊपर काम करना चाहिए तो आस्था को समझना चाहिए जो। जो लोग आस्था के प्रति जा रहे हैं उनको प्रोत्साहित करना चाहिए उनको पालन करना चाहिए। पालन के साथ-साथ पॉलिसी मेकिंग में लाना चाहिए। स्ट्रिप्टर पॉलिसी मेकर्स को ये बुद्धि नहीं आएगी उनको समझ में नहीं आएगा वो अपने पॉलिसी जो है मार्केट ड्रिमेंट होगा या इंडस्ट्रियल होगा तो यह पॉलिसी सही नहीं बनी नहीं बनती है कि पॉलिसी चेंज में सैकड़ों 

Speaker 1  (16:11)
साल लग जाता है। 

Speaker 2  (16:12)
तब तक बहुत लेटर जाते हैं बहुत लेटर। 

Speaker 1  (16:15)
तो एक ट्विस्ट जो काफी पेस्ट होता है जो रिसर्च जो है उसको बंद करना चाहिए कोई भी पद्धति है चाहे परिवार में हो या व्यक्ति समाज में अपनी आस्था होती है। इसको पॉलिसी में लाने के लिए कई सारे जैसे निजी बहुत सारे कुछ कोशिश करना चाहिए हमें इसके लिए लड़ना चाहिए अपनी जो भारतीय धरोहर जो है कोई? भी फेस्टिवल ये भी आस्था जो है ये अंधविश्वास नहीं है। इसके पीछे बहुत बड़ी चुकी है। उसको मानने के लिए अपने पॉलिसी मेकर्स को पॉलिटिकल लीडर्स को लीडरशिप को स्टूडेंट्स को प्रोत्साहित करना चाहिए। इसको सब्जेक्ट में स्कूल और कॉलेज सब्जेक्ट में लाना चाहिए। तब जाकर यह ठीक होगा कि बोलना चाहिए? 

Speaker 1  (17:18)
नहीं तो जो है हम भी नेत्रों को भी नहीं कर पाएंगे कुछ और करना पडेगा।

Speaker 1  (17:49)
कर्मकांड जो है इसके ऊपर बहुत सारे हैं 

Speaker 1  (18:10)
जहां तक अभी मैंने सुख पाया पढ़ पाया उतना ही मैं कह सकता हूं क्या इसके ऊपर टिप्पणी करने के लिए मैं असमर्थ भी? मैं अपने आपको महसूस करता हूं क्योंकि इसके ऊपर मेरा अभिनय कम हो और कई लोग कई सारे बुद्धिजीवी लोग टिप्पणी करने का प्रयास करते हैं उनको? नहीं करना चाहिए जो इसके ऊपर सब्जेक्स्ट नहीं मैं डॉक्टर हूँ। इसके राते कोई भी जो मेडिकल संबंधित चीजें जितना तक मॉडर्न सेंस में मैने पड़ा नहीं कर सकता लोगों को जो है उस चीज़ में नई टिप्पणी करना से जिसके ऊपर अपना अध्ययन नहीं तो मैं इससे भी ज्यादा टिप्पणी नहीं कर पाऊंगा मगर आस्था जो है 

Speaker 1  (19:07)
अपना रिटर्न तो पूरा करना है तो इसलिए जो है। बुक को बंद करके आपसे मैने कुछ लिया है 

Speaker 1  (19:30)
तो आपको वापस करना पडेगा। उसकी पिछले माध्यम से हम अपने व्यक्ति को संतुष्टि देती है दूसरा संबंधित प्रश्न में पूरा जवाब इसलिए नहीं किया। 

Speaker 2  (19:52)
बिल्कुल ठीक है आप अपने से बाहर नहीं जाना चाहते। 

Speaker 1  (19:56)
घर जा सकता हूं गलत टिप्पणी। 

Speaker 2  (20:01)
नहीं बिल्कुल ठीक है भाई साथ। 

Speaker 1  (20:05)
अपने पास एक गोत्र बना हुआ सिस्टम जो है बहुत ही सेंटिफिक चीजें हैं जो एक ही पुत्र में शादियां नहीं होती। इसका विषय नहीं है कि सर्टिफिकेट डीएनए और उनका जो है मैचिंग नहीं हो पाता उसकी संतान जो है ब्रीडिंग के साथ खराब हो उनको कई सारी बीमारियों का सामना करना पड़ सकता है। बिहार गया में सुबह 1:00 a.m. पंडित उनकी बिरादरी है कि। तारीख पर नहीं जाऊंगा मैं सीताजी का सीताजी के जुड़े हुए एक कहानी है तो डीवन मैरी आउट ऑफ़ डे तो डिलीवरी। 

Speaker 2  (20:59)
जिसमें विकृतियां। 

Speaker 1  (21:03)
तो ऐसा कई सारे का अड्डा बन जाता है इसलिए जो है हमें आज तक साइंस के ऊपर टिप्पणी करने के पहले उसका साइंटिफिक रिसर्च पूरा होना चाहिए। अंग्रेजी पढ़ाई है सिर्फ मंदिर भी सीखने चले गए भारतीय शास्त्र अपना विद्युत भविष्य के पुराने की क्लास लेकिन इतने बड़े लोग हैं मोदी जीके लोग इसको एक आसान तरीका। बनाया उसको मैं भूल गया। ल्मी कोशिश करेंगे हम उतना तक ही जाते हैं जहां तक है ऊपर पढाई पढ़ाने वाले नहीं पढ़ाने वाला नहीं क्यों कई सारे वेद पाठशाला में संरक्षित हूं जिसमें अपना जो नहीं सकता तो इसको जो है इस तरह की इच्छा समझना चाहिए कि हम ठीक करना चाहिए धीरे धीरे अध्ययन करके शिक्षा पद्धति। 

Speaker 2  (22:17)
इक्कोजी रीमा के लिए आपका क्या मैसेज हो सकता है? ग्लोबल साइंटिफिक कम्युनिटी को नंबर 1 आपने उत्तर भी दिया है इसका लेकिन संक्षेप में एक बार और देना चाहें तो और ग्लोबल यूथ के लिए। 

Speaker 1  (22:32)
हजारों लापू करदो साल का धरोहर है इस शब्द को इसलिए कह रहा हूं कि एक नया एक शब्द प्रयोग करना शुरू किया है। 

Speaker 2  (22:53)
ओके। 

Speaker 1  (22:54)
ठीक है इसका अर्थ क्या है कि सिर्फ भारतीय पद्धति केवल कोई भी अपना टिप्पणी करें उसके लिए संस्कृति या अपनी पद्धति के ऊपर क्वालिफाइड होना चाहिए। मैं जितना हद तक मैं जा सकता हूँ मैं पगड़ी को जानता हूँ टिप्पणी कर सकता हूं कोई भी दूसरा पदाधिका जो साइंटिस्ट इसके ऊपर रिसर्च करके अपने। अपना टिप्पणी नहीं दे सकता लेना नहीं चाहिए। 

Speaker 2  (23:16)
पहले उसको उसमें पंडित होना जरूरी है। 

Speaker 1  (23:19)
तो ऐसी सेंटिफिक रिसर्च होना चाहिए कि जो इस पद्धति में अध्यक्ष हो पारंगत हो तो उनको इसके ऊपर टिप्पणी करने के लिप्रोत्साहित करना चाहिए भारत सरकार को जो है इसकी इसके विषय के ऊपर बहुत गहराई से सोचना चाहिए। साइंटिस्ट को बाहर से डिप्लॉट करने के पहले यूनिवर्सिटी में। जो भारतीय पद्धति को प्रवेश रक्षा देना चाहिए उनके ऊपर उनको खुद को रिसर्च जो है अपने जो पुरानी जो इतिहास जो किताबें हैं। उनको धूल मिट्टी झाड़कर वापस खाते उनके ऊपर खुद को अध्ययन करता है। हालांकि बाहर के जो अच्छी पद्धति उसको लाने सके इसलिए कोई दवाई चाहिए कि वेस्ट में जी की एंड डिस्टर्न अल्टीमेटली पूरी लिस्ट में अच्छा है ऐसे तो मैं ऐसा नहीं।

Speaker 2  (00:34)
मैं यही कहूंगा कि सिर्फ पैसों से नहीं होगा प्रोजेक्ट बड़े बड़े प्रोजेक्ट आते पैसा भी करोड़ों की तादाद में खर्च होता है लेकिन जब तक व्यक्ति की मानसिकता नहीं बदलेगी जब तक सेल्फ डिसिप्लिन नहीं आएगी क्योंकि मेरी माँ हैं हम घर में जैसे पान की पिचकारी नहीं मारते भरे ऊपर कहीं भी थूकते। हैं क्योंकि मारते की मेरा घर था। लेकिन माँ में माँ का जो किनारा है उधर मैं प्रदूषण। नहीं करना चाहिए ये जब तक ये सेल्फ डिसिप्लिन डेवलपमेंट होगी तब तक ये प्रॉब्लम सॉल्व नहीं होगा कम हो सकता है करोड़ों रुपये खर्च करने से प्रोजेक्ट करने से कम हो सकता है लेकिन पूरा अगर मान लो ये जो सारे प्रॉब्लम्स उनको सॉल्व करना है तो मानसिकता। बतानी पड़ेगी और मानसिकता तब बनेगी कि सब में एक सेल्फ बेसिक लायक ये मेरी माँ है।

यह संस्कृति बहुत ठीक है और हम शरीर से ज्यादा आत्मा बाकी चीजों को मानते हैं मेरा पहला प्रश्न ही वही है जो हमारे वर्ली अफेयर्स हैं जैसे कि खाना पीना सोना सुख दुःख ठंड गर्मी बरसात और जो हम आध्यात्म की बात करते हैं इनमें कोई कनेक्शन है या दो अलग-अलग चीज़ है। और मैं मतलब हमारे धर्म कर्मकांड और बाकी ध्यान में ये चीज़ें न खोजें मतलब आपका क्या मालूम है? 

Speaker 2  (00:29)
अध्यात्म भी अलग ही धर्म भी अलग है कर्मकांड भी अलग है कर्मकांड एक प्रोफेशनल रूपी कह सकते हैं धर्मगुरु आज क्या है? कितना सस्ता बना कि जिसके कारण जो आम जनता है पब्लिक है उनको धर्म के ऊपर से क्योंकि हजारों ने लाखों में बहुत कम ऐसे साधु संत या तो महात्मा या तो? सिद्ध योगी हमारा जो जीवन का अंतिम लक्ष्य है वो परम प्राप्त देता है मोक्ष कार्य। लेकिन ताकि किसी को मालूम नहीं या तो प्राप्त करना चाहते उनको तो ये जो आता है शॉर्ट हर्ट शॉर्टकट में हमें कुछ मिले खास करके भौतिक सम्पत्ति अजगवन के पास जाते संत महात्मा के पास जाते तो यह मानते हो मोक्ष में मांगे परम शांति मेरे घर गाड़ी बँगला एडमिशन हो जाए बेटी। की शादी हो जाए। अच्छी जगह एडमिशन मिल जाए। बहुत सारे भविष्य मिल जाये स्वास्थ्य अच्छा नहीं होते। सिर्फ एक मानते हैं क्योंकि उन्होंने आध्यात्म और धर्म के दिए हमको कोई फर्क नहीं इसलिए स्थिति है और आजकल जो ऐसे चमत्कार वाले यू दिग्विजन और इतना ही विधि करना अपने आप बच्चा होगा क्या तो आप यह होगा और आप भी मानते की मान लो 10 लोगों को कहते तो 5 लोगों का। ऐसा ही सही सोता है। मान लेते हैं संत की कृपा हुई हो रहा था जिनका

अमर बाबू की बात करे बाबू सिंह ने क्षति खोरी साधना की। महाराज की प्राप्ति भी उन्होंने लिए कुछ नहीं माना तक विश्व का कल्याण हो ऐसा कुछ हो मुझे तो आपको चरण चाहिए मेरी इच्छा थी कि आपके पास से दिन पूजा होगी और कुछ मुझे दिमाग में तो ये मंत्र देवी देवताओं के सामने कोई भी व्यक्ति एक मंत्र जाप करेगा तो उनको शान्ति मिला शांतियाने शारीरिक मानसिक। सभी प्रकार सभी को शांति मिली। और आध्यात्म की ओर परम प्राप्ति की आगे बढ़ेगा तो वर्धन मंत्र का कैसा अनुभव है? एक पुरा कोई भी व्यक्ति हो ये मंत्र करके मेरे प्रकार को मैं बता सकूं कि 3344 घंटा इतना शांति मिलती है और अम कहते हैं कि लक्ष्मी की तरह यह कहना हो गया खुद ब खुद। आसानी से हमने प्रयास किया। बाकी तो आजकल माया छोड़ दो चापयुधौ ओह प्रारों को त्याग हो इतना अजीज नहीं है तो एक काम करना या तो इसमें से रुचि कम होना ये मुद्रा के कारण बताए। तभी तो अभी की जमी हो सकती थी। उन्होंने पूरी जिंदगी इसी को न तो शिष्य बनाए न की बात भी है न प्यार छूने दिए तो हमेशा कहते तुम्हें गुरु ने। मैं उनके बेटे खड़ा हुआ चौकीदार हाँ मैं आपको गुरुथक सद्गुरु तक ले जा सकता हूँ। इतना

कैपेसिटी में रहने मैं गुरु नहीं हमारे सबके पूरी है तो एक रहना ये इतना निजी नहीं है। आजकल शिशुओं की कई जगहों पर ऐसा होता है कि शिष्य बनने के बाद उनका प्रमोशन या तो अलग-अलग गति मिलती कई प्रोफेशनल। प्रकार से भी प्रयास किए जाते उसी जगह शिष्य न बनाना इसी को कंठी ना किसी से कुछ लेने की अपेक्षा न रखना 21। कक्षा पर पहुंचने के बाद भी हो सकता है। आज हमारा जो घनावी आश्रम है और ऋषिकेश में हैं तो दोनों जगह आज तक किसी से कोई रुपया कभी कभी नहीं माँगा न माँग रहे यहाँ। अभी प्रयागराज में महाकुंभ में अपडेट में साधु संतों के लिए आई चेक-अप चल रहा है। ये पूरा कुंभ में चलेगा पूरा कुण्ड में साधु संतों का आई चेक-अप मेडिसिन एल्ब्राक्ष और चश्मा फिर दिया जाता है बाजू में मेडिसिन विभाग जहां जहां जहां साधु संतों का भी होता है जो मेरे सिंचाई। मेडिसिन भी जाती है। बड़े भाव से प्रेम से उनको खाना खिलाया जाता है। ये पूरा दो महीना सामाजिक सेवा की अपरूपियां चलती है। ऐसे तो पूरे 12 मास दोनों जगह और भी एक्टिविटीज मानवे परिवार हैं बच्चा एकदम होशार पढ़ नहीं सकता। पुलिस के कारण आर्थिक स्थिति के कारण अपने बच्चों पर गरीबों को कपड़े

Speaker 1  (07:09)
अगर मेरी सेवा का भाव चाहूंगा मैं समझना चाह रहा हूँ कि जैसे ये आप लोग का तीसरा कुंभ है आप जैसा आप बता रहे हैं जब से आप लोग कुम को जानते है उसमें किस प्रकार का बदलाव आया है? क्या वो उस पॉज़ेटिविटी की तरफ है या उसमें कुछ नेगेटिविटीज भी साथ से जुड़ी हैं उसमें। आपका, क्या मानना है? 

Speaker 2  (07:30)
देखो एक कुंभ है कुंभ मेला यहाँ आने वाले सबका उद्देश्य अलग-अलग रहता है सब प्रकार का मिलता मानों कई लोग जो आते हैं और मेले को एन्जॉय करने के लिए आते हैं कई लोग जो है वो इमिटेड होके भी चलो ये सब जा रहे तो हम भी स्नान करके आए लेकिस्तान का। क्या महत्व है? हम क्यों जा रहे हमारा उद्देश्य क्या है? उनको उद्देश्य ही मालूम नहीं सब बुझा रहे हैं। निकल पडे यानी यात्रा की तरह जैसे जर्मी शुरू की है लेकिन उनको उद्देश्य मालूम नहीं ऐसे भी लोग आते क्योंकि यहां तो लाखों या तो करोड़ों की तादात में जो लोग आ रहे हैं तो सबका अलग-अलग मकसद होगा यहाँ सेवा भाव वाला भी व्यक्ति होगा लेने वाला ठीक होगा देने वाला भी होगा। एन्जॉय करने वाला भी होगा लूटने वाला भी होगा। व्यापार करने वाला भी होगा। मैंने सबका उद्देश्य यानी मैं कह सकता हूं कि यहाँ जो आता है जिनको जो चाहिए वो मिलता है जिनको है लोग या पूरे दिन में पहले गाते आपके सामने दो लोग उनको हमें दिया वो पढ़ रहे हैं जो ये वरदानें मंत्रिका भला वर्धन मंत्र क्या होगा तो इन मंत्र से पॉजिटिविटी आत्मा नहीं। टिविटी लीनजिंग वाला जो प्रोसेस होता है इंटरनल क्लिंजिंग। उसी से क्या होता है

Speaker 1  (11:22)
हमारी जो भारतीय संस्कृति है और जैविधता के प्रति किस प्रकार रुख रखती है और उसके संरक्षण के लिए लिया? 

Speaker 2  (11:31)
इसके प्रति। 

Speaker 1  (11:33)
जैव विविधता मतलब जंगी जानवर पशु पक्षी नदी पहाड़ यस। 

Speaker 2  (11:40)
जैविकता और संस्कृति दोनों एक सिक्के के दो बाजों की तरह है हमारे पूजा होती है पीपल की पूजा होती है कोई भी वनस्पति से ले के बड़े पेड़ पूजा भी की जाती है। चैतूल सिर को वर्णों को पीपल हो हिजरे का वृक्ष हो जो कहते हैं बाध्य थे बकरी है उनका वाहन राय देवी देवता। चाहे वह सुआ हो चाहे चाहे को बिल्कुल भी प्राणी या तो पक्षी ले लो इतना सम्मान दिया उनके पास रखा है दत्त महाराज के ने तो अक्षा गुरु बनाए छायात्रा दत्तात्रेय महाराज ने तो अच्छा गुरु बनाए थे और कहा था कि अच्छा गुरु याने गुरू ये है कि जो हमे सही दिशा बताते जिससे। हमें कुछ सीखना मिलता है उन्होंने तो। कछुआ है कुत्ता है कुत्ता में भी वफादारी का गुण मिलता है तो अलग-अलग प्राणी है पक्षी है सब में से कुछ न कुछ भी मिलता है तो पूरा सम्मान हमारी संस्कृति में तो जैविकता को दिया हुआ है हर महान से सिर्फ मानते उनको सम्मान करके स्पर्श करते हैं शैलियों के रूप में भी ये जो हैं। ये इस्तेमाल होता है। 

Speaker 1  (13:36)
क्लाइमेट चेंज की मैप से बात करता हूं जलवायु परिवर्तन हो रहा है अनियमित बारिश धुप आँधी तूफ़ान सब कुछ है। क्या सनातन धर्म या क्या हमारे गुरु महाराज? हमारे माताजी इसके बारे में कोई सॉल्यूशन बताती है कि किस प्रकार हम ऐसे ह्यूमन किसी को अच्छा कर सकते हैं। 

Speaker 2  (13:58)
इसलिए जो पहला प्रश्न था इसके पहले इसके साथ ये जुड़ा हुआ प्रश्न है पर्यावरण को अगर हम संचित असंवर्धन करेंगे रक्षा करेंगे तो ये जो सारे जो प्रॉब्लम्स ग्लोबल वार्मिंग है ग्लोबल वॉर मेन पर्यावरण का नुकसान हो रहे पेड़ पौधे जंगल काट रहे हैं इसलिए तो सुख रही है ये अगर पर्यावरण के प्रति सभी धर्म। में इतना यीजो अवेयरनेस आएगा। तो मैं मानता हूँ कि पर्यावरण उनको बचा पाएंगे जंगल करते हुए बचा पाएंगे तो एक ग्लोबल वॉर्मिंग यात्रा ऐसी जो घटनाएँ घटती हैं। 

Speaker 1  (14:45)
क्या आपकी संस्था मतलब लोगों को भी कम करने के लिए या क्लाइमेट चेंज से संबंधित कोई स्पेसिफिक कार्य भी कर रही है? 

Speaker 2  (14:53)
हमारा ये जो मैंने बताया हमारा आश्रम है 50 एकड़ में लेकिन आप उधर आओगे तो पूरा जंगल हमें बचाते रहता क्या लगता है इतना कंसेप्शन भी नहीं खूंटी रखें तो भी वो पूरे जंगल के बीच में है तो एनवायरमेंट को हमें करके रखा है ताकि हवा भी शुद्ध मिले पहले। भी शुद्ध मिले। एन्वायरमेंट भी शुद्ध मिले और। साधना मार्ग के साथ-साथ व्यतिका स्वास्थ्य भी सही होगा वो मन सही रहेगा। जी स्वास्थ्य सही होगा और मानसिक स्वास्थ्य सही रहेगा। शारीरिक स्वास्थ्य। ब्रह्माणा को हमेशा प्रयास रहता है दूसरा प्लास्टिक का जो यूज वाला है कि हम ज्यादातर काम करते। 

Speaker 1  (15:43)
माँ गंगा की बात करता हूँ मैं आपसे थोड़ी सी अभी एक साइंटिफिक पेपर्स निकले थे। कुछ इंटरनेशनल मतलब लोकल लिंक उसमें उन्होंने बहुत रेली मेंशन किया है कि गंगा माता इज़ बायोलॉजिकली डेड अर्थात जैसे कोई भी न हो। हम या किसी भी व्यक्ति को हम जीवन तब मानते है जब उसके अन्दर ऑक्सीजन चल रहा हो प्रोपरली गंगा माता का जो केमिकल एनालिसिस हुआ। उसमें जो ऑक्सीजन डिमांड होना चाहिए उनके अन्दर जो फाइटोप्लांट्स जो प्लैक्टांस और जो बाकी बायोलॉजिकल जो भी जीव जंतु होने चाहिए कम के बराबर है उसके अलावा फिकल कंटेंट बहुत ज़्यादा है ये उनका प्राइमरी स्टेटमेंट है कि गंगा माता इस बायोजिकली डेड उसके बाद भी हमें। महाकुंभ देख रहे हैं। पूरे जीवन में इतनी भीड़ आज तक कभी नहीं मम्मी जितनी अभी उमड़ी है। इसका आपने शुरुआत में कुछ हद तक उत्तर बिल्कुल भी दे दिया था कि बहुत सारे कारणों से लोग यहाँ पे आते हैं ये होने के बाद भी गंगा माता में ऐसी क्या शक्ति है कि लोग उनमें डुबकी लगाना आज भी जरूरी समझते हैं या? 

Speaker 2  (16:54)
देखो ये जो अर्ध कुंभ होते कुंड होते कि महापूर्ण है 144 यानी 1 44 जीजस के बाद ही आया हमारा 12 साल का एक कुंभ होता है फिर ऐसे भारत के बाद यह है तो ये साइंटिफिक भी है धार्मिक का महत्व है स्पिरिचली तो है। नक्षत्र और एक लाइन मैप यह तो है साइंटिफिक भी एक महत्व रखता है। हमारे धर्मशास्त्रों में क्या किया है कि कई बातें ऐसी हैं और साइंटिफिकली भी मैं ही पूर्व है उद्रो के साथ जोड़ दिया तो यह धर्म के हिसाब से दोनों हिसाब से इतने सालों के बाद आए इसलिए दूसरा लोगों में अगर गवर्नमेंटल या प्रशासन की ओर से भी त्रिपुरा और धर्माचार्य तो? 

Speaker 2  (17:48)
अलग-अलग धर्म गुरुओं के द्वारा संगठनों के द्वारा भी इस कुंभ के प्रति। संख्याएँ दूसरी बात आपने बताये कि गंगा को डेर बढ़ता है ये भी हो सकता है कि कई जगह गंगाजी के प्रबंध भी ग्लैश्यार ग्लोबल वार्मिंग का भी एक कारण है लेकिन मैं मानता हूँ कि आज भी गंगाजल और नदी का और कोई भी जगह से चाहित हुआ हो चाहे बोर। हो चाहे कोई भी जगह से तालाब हो। पानी लाकर रखो थोड़े दिन के बाद इस में स्मैल आ जाएगा। ये गंगा जल ऐसा एक जल है गंगा जल जन कभी साधारणा तपिश मिलने क्या बता रहे हैं मैं नहीं मानता कि बायोलॉजिकली ये 1 1/2 ये भी हो सकता है तो साइंस के स्टुडेन्ड ऑफ्रीसर्च करे। डिपेंड ऑन सैंपल अब सैंपल कहाँ से ले रहे हैं? 

Speaker 2  (18:50)
मान लो यहाँ इतने लोग स्नान करोड़ों की तादाद में अपने यहाँ से मानलो गंगा जल का सैंपल लिया और उनका एनालिसिस किया। सूसी कैसे बैंगलोर सैंपल लो और फिर एनालिसिस करो। आपको प्रयाग रुद्रप्रयाग प्रयाग उधर से एनालिसिस करो। 

Speaker 1  (19:18)
इस नदी को हम माता मानते हैं और ये भी जानते हैं कि उसमें इतने लोग डुबकी लगाएंगे तो प्रदूषित होंगी। तो उसके बाद भी हम ये काम क्यों करते हैं? आपको, क्या लगता है। 

Speaker 2  (19:29)
लेकिन यह धर्म आस्था का भी विषय हृदय है आस्था का विषय और ये चलता जल है मानो कूए का जल अग्र होगा वह प्रदूषित हो सकता है मैं मानता लेकिन ये चलता हुआ जल है मेरी का जो प्रवाह है इसमें मैं मानवता को इतना प्रदूषित था प्रदूषित होगा लेकिन चलने के कारण प्रदूषण पितो चलता प्रवाह का। पानी होता तालाब का पानी को पूरा स्टेटमेंट रहता है प्रदूषित हो जाता है। पर इतनी तादात में धर्म के साथ जुड़ा है तो प्लस माइनस मानलो थोड़ा प्रदूषित भी होगा और उसके सामने कई लोगों ने उस राहत अच्छा और गवर्नमेंट के द्वारा भी इसके प्रति और धर्माचारी या तो अलग-अलग एंजियोज हैं।

Speaker 2  (01:26)
कहां से देखा है? 

Speaker 1  (01:27)
टीवी मोबाइल या उनका कोई दोस्त? मोबाइल को बंद करने की बिल्कुल मेरी इच्छा है। 

Speaker 2  (01:41)
बच्चों को सलाह अच्छी होगी। 

Speaker 1  (01:47)
चेक देखो। 

Speaker 2  (01:48)
मेरा कुछ भी। बाबू ने कहा कि अगर आप उससे। 

Speaker 1  (01:56)
किसी भी आपके पास हमारी रोशन की समस्या। 

Speaker 4  (01:59)
मुझे हमारी चीजें। 

Speaker 2  (02:03)
युवा दूसरा। 

Speaker 1  (02:06)
बहुत अच्छी बात है उसी ऑब्जेक्टिव से मैं आया हूँ कि मैं इस महत्त्व से ऐसा क्या मैसेज लेके जा सकता हूँ? मैने ग्रामीण स्तर में कैपेसिटी बिल्डिंग और कुछ कुछ इंटरनेशनल लेवल पर कन्वेंशन। ट्रेनिंग देना मतलब गाँव वालों को की किस प्रकार जैसे कि जैविकता संरक्षण में काहनों में काम कर रहे हैं हमारे जो वैद्य जी लोग होते हैं गुरु महाराज जो होते हैं बहुत सारी जडी बूटियों की दवाइयां बनाते हैं और यह कहां से लेकर आते हैं घने जंगलों से लेकर लेकिन अब जैसे कि अगर। मैं कमर्शियल कंपनी की बात कर रही हूँ। पतंजलि किस प्रकार बनती है इस प्रकार संरक्षण करना चाहिए। 

Speaker 2  (03:04)
जेमी साथी उस आधार पर छत्तीसगढ़ के गांवों में प्रतापगढ़ जिले की प्रसिद्ध पूरे भारत में जैसे काशी उस तरीके से काफी प्रसिद्ध हैं प्रेरित करते हैं। सप्लाई चाहिए तो जंगल से नहीं हो पाएगा। 

Speaker 3  (03:58)
ठीक है। 

Speaker 1  (03:59)
मेरा यहाँ पे भी ऑब्जेक्टीम है कि मैं किसी की आलोचना करूं या सपोर्ट करो। मैंने मतलब हम कहां जा रहे हैं? 

Speaker 2  (04:09)
आपने जैसे अपना ध्यान देने किए हैं उनका काम ही क्यों है इसमें और करियर निवारण की बात लोअर ऑथेंटिक स्कूल में काम किया जा सकता है। 

Speaker 1  (04:19)
ठीक है तो किसी चीज़ यह है कि जैसे से मॉडर्न युग आ रहा है बच्चे जैसे कि अगर मैं बच्चे डिस्थल पैदा हो रहे हैं बच्चे इससे पहले क्या है कि गाँव में रहते थे उनके पिताजी अगर वैद्य हैं तो आज के समय में क्योंकि उस वाले काम में पैसा नहीं रहा नहीं नहीं नहीं बता रहा। हूँ आप जानते भी होंगे। 

Speaker 4  (04:49)
करके वैद्य बन रहे हैं तो वो भी अपने बच्चों को बीएमएस करा रहे हैं। 

Speaker 1  (04:54)
कम से कम। 

Speaker 2  (04:55)
आपके पास यदि डिग्री नहीं है तो गवर्नमेंट मान्यता नहीं दे सकते ऐसे तो कुछ भी कुछ भी कर सकता है। 

Speaker 4  (05:02)
इसी के चलते जब गांवों में जो गाँव का आदमी जो कि समझता था कि यह क्या चीज़ है यह कौन सा पौधा है इसका क्या उपयोग है वह समस्या को जा रहा है क्योंकि लोगों को पढ़ा नहीं रहेगा चीजों को। 

Speaker 3  (05:14)
वो उसी पर चोट कराई। पूरे काम कोर्सी पर जाकर। 

Speaker 2  (05:18)
जब आवश्यकता विश्व। 

Speaker 3  (05:21)
आवश्यकता होती है जो महल अपने राज। 

Speaker 2  (05:25)
मेडिकल देखेंगे मेडिकल का जो कॉलेज है ठीक है क्योंकि प्रैक्टिकल आपको करना है उस आधार पर उस चीज़ कराया जाता है। बहुत सारे के बारे में जानते हैं वनस्पति देखी होगी। 

Speaker 4  (05:50)
हर बडे नहीं जानते। 

Speaker 2  (05:51)
लेकिन मैं नहीं। 

Speaker 4  (05:56)
डीएम वाले नाम जानता है। 

Speaker 1  (06:03)
जो आयुर्वेद के जो सैटिसाइड। मेडिकल ऑफिसर होते हैं। 

Speaker 2  (06:07)
दुबई में सवालों को शुरुआत के प्रति के सारे में से उनका वही कोष है। 

Speaker 1  (06:15)
ठीक है महाराज। 

Speaker 2  (06:16)
4 को पढ़ाया जाता है। 

Speaker 1  (06:19)
आप एकदम ठीक बोल रहे हैं मैं किसी बात रखना चाह रहा था कि जो जैसे छत्तीसगढ़ के जो हमारे वैद्य हैं जो पढ़े लिखे हुए हैं लेकिन उनका गुजर मुश्किल हो रखा है। 

Speaker 2  (06:33)
प्रत्यानंद नारंदर। 

Speaker 1  (06:43)
जो और क्या है? 

Speaker 2  (06:44)
बी.ए. भी पीएचडी स्कूटर हैं लड़के वो पढ़ाई तो करते प्रैक्टिस निकलती है। आयुर्वेद को विज्ञान की दृष्टि से करेंगे कितना पैसा लगेगा शुरू कर दिया है 

Speaker 2  (07:29)
राज्य क्षेत्र है। 

Speaker 4  (07:32)
राजीव की स्थिति के साथ। 

Speaker 2  (07:36)
उनके चारों से बात चुने थे कि इस विषय में कुछ थोड़ा जानकारी होनी चाहिए। क्षेत्र में प्रसिद्ध हैं। अपने आयुर्वेद के अलग-अलग राज्य थे। फिर ने कहा कि आप इनाम करो कि बीएमएस को काम डिग्री की आवश्यकता होगी और इसमें रुचि हैं। आप आगे बढ़ सकते हैं। कितने वर्ष सिटी के गहरे पैसे बहुत दूर क्षेत्र के द्वारा गवर्नमेंट कार्रवाई होनी चाहिए? और अपने जो विषय है उसके प्रति प्रेरणा प्रेम जी हां इसमें वह गहराई से बताएं अब क्यों थोड़ी सी कुछ आपने यदि दोनों को ठीक कर दिया करें? उन्होंने अपनी परंपरा में छुपा रखा है ज्ञान नहीं दोगे तो क्या होगा जैसे कैसे कर सकें परंपरागत किसी चीज़ में विशेषज्ञ है आयुर्वेद से ठीक कर देते हैं कोई भी। चीजें ठीक है अपनी पीढ़ी को बस दे रहा अपनी पीढ़ी को देना। 

Speaker 4  (09:57)
पीढी में कोई आदमी का इंटरेस्ट नहीं हुआ। 

Speaker 2  (10:01)
अब खेलेगा कैसे पीएम? 

Speaker 1  (10:02)
किसी को संरक्षित करने के लिए हम लोग प्रयास कर रहे हैं। 

Speaker 2  (10:08)
खेलो प्रत्येक एक्सपीरियंस के सेमिनार होते बढ़ते हैं तभी तो इसका रेज विकापुर हैं। 

Speaker 4  (10:14)
जो है अग्रवाल जी का तेल बनाकर हाँ होम के परिवार के अलावा किसी को नहीं बना सकते। 

Speaker 1  (10:21)
अच्छा तो बाहर निकलन। 

Speaker 4  (10:23)
नहीं नहीं बनाते वो पहले बनाते थे देवी का बेटा मेरे साथी और उसकी पत्नी बना लेती है लेकिन दूसरा किसी को नहीं पता। 

Speaker 1  (10:33)
पारिवारिक। 

Speaker 2  (10:35)
पारिवारिक कदम मिलेगा तो वो संगीत सोच के कारण बातचीत। 

Speaker 4  (10:39)
अब इसे बेटा है। उनका जान भले जाएगा। लेकिन जब इंजीनियर हो गया तो उधर चला जाएगा। 

Speaker 2  (10:45)
उचित सोच के कारण आप जितना प्रकृति कहते हैं कि मुर्गे बकरे नहीं खाएंगे तो इनकी संख्या बढ़ जाएगी। 

Speaker 4  (11:00)
इसलिए पढ़ा रहे हैं। 

Speaker 2  (11:03)
आयुर्वेद का जितना प्रचार करोगे आपकी उतनी बढ़ेगी क्योंकि पता था नहीं लगे। 

Speaker 4  (11:19)
ये हमारे पास एक फल भी पू। 

Speaker 2  (11:22)
तो भी आवश्यक है लेकिन यह सब लेकिन इस साइकोलॉजी को भी समझना पड़ेगा कि भाई वो बना बनना चाहिए थे उसके लिए भी बना के दे दिया और भी गाड़ी। 

Speaker 4  (11:43)
और भी बात है। इसमें मिला लेना इतना ही मिला आएगा। 

Speaker 2  (11:48)
मिलाता है बहुत सारी है वैसे बनती है जानकारी जानक। 

Speaker 1  (11:55)
हमारा एक निवेदन था पर्सनेरे वीडियोग्राफी की टीम आई है। 

Speaker 3  (12:04)
आप लोगों। 

Speaker 2  (12:04)
मुझको बता दें कि आपको इधर पुस्तक। 

Speaker 3  (12:08)
कुछ दूसरे भगवान मूत्र। 

Speaker 2  (12:09)
गुलाम नहीं बता दीजिए उससे ऑनलाइन। 

Speaker 1  (12:26)
तुम्हारा जी जो कोई संयुक्त राष्ट्र पर लिखना है उसके लिए वीडियोग्राफी हमारी टीम आ रही है परसों तो परसों या उसके आध दिन बाद अगर आपका एक घंटा मिल जाता तो हम लोग उससे संबंधित आपसे चर्चा करना चाहते थे वीडियो के माध्यम से। 

Speaker 2  (12:42)
और चर्चा करना था कि और भी आइडिया हो कि आपको बहुत अच्छी बात है या चीजें प्रक्रिया उसमें शामिल करने इन चीजों पर हमने नहीं किया जी बिल्कुल पहले से सूक्ष्मता लेगी। 

Speaker 1  (12:56)
बहुत अच्छा मारा। तो, क्या कल आपके साथ बैठकर समय निकाल सकते हैं? 

Speaker 2  (13:02)
मेरे पत्ते में कहीं जाना तो नहीं है हमने? बिल्कुल मैम क्या थोड़ा समय देख लें तब तक बैठिए। कुछ लिए बैठे आती हूँ। पुस्तक बैठ के पढ़िए 

Speaker 4  (13:13)
नहीं नहीं की चीजों को जाती है। 

Speaker 2  (13:19)
नहीं उसी में साथ में साथ में हाँ वह समुदाय।

Speaker 2  (13:47)
इस पर काम करते हैं आटा छीनने लगे। 

Speaker 4  (13:54)
यहाँ के लिए ना सर्दी ठीक करें? 

Speaker 2  (14:03)
बॉलीवुड का काम करते हैं या प्राकृतिक खेती पर करते हैं। 

Speaker 1  (14:07)
सब चीजें हमारे काम से जुड़ी हुई एक्चुअली तो प्राकृतिक खेती का भी हमारा एक ऑब्जेक्टिव रजिस्टर मिलना होगा। 

Speaker 2  (14:16)
ऐसे कैसे करता है? 

Speaker 1  (14:18)
बेसिकली जो अपने यहां एडिशनल खेती के लिए एक सबसे बड़ी चीज़ मानी गई है कि सारी शक्ति अपनी मिट्टी में होती है तो मिट्टी आज के समय में पूरे केमिकल साल के उसको खत्म कर दिया गया है। उसको बायोलॉजिकली मृत घोषित कर दिया गया है। उसको वापस जीवंत कैसे करना है वह किस प्रकार से वापस उत्पन्न होने की कगार पर हैं। यह लगभग 3 साल का प्रोसेस होगा। 

Speaker 2  (14:48)
संस्कृत। 

Speaker 1  (14:49)
हमारी संस्था एक औरागा इनोवेटिव लैम्प्स प्राइवेट लिमिटेड का एक स्टार्टअप कंपनी है। यह छत्तीसगढ़ में 2017 से कार्यरत हैं। तो भारत सरकार हो गया संयुक्त राष्ट्र की हिन्दू संस्थाएं हैं जैसे आईसीएआर के साथ जुड़े हुए हैं। दोनों पॉलिसीकर मामलों में आपको बैंक कंसल्टेंसी भी देते हैं और छात्र रिसर्च पेपर्स आर्टिकल ग्राउंड 2 यूनिकेशन इस प्रकार करना है। हाँ। कुछ कहना बंद कर देता हो जाएगा लेकिन वो होगा नहीं ना विविधता चाहिए। 

Speaker 3  (15:31)
नियम है इतना ही साथ बड़ा हो जाओ हमला प्रकृति अपनी को अपना नियम चलाती देश आजाद हुआ था। अब इतिहास पढ़िए कांग्रेस ने कांग्रेस में अहम आगे जब मतदाता को बताता। उन्होंने इनका इस इंडिया इंडियंस जिंदा एक नारा लगा था। इंडियाई संग्रह 415 से 44 सीटा की हम उनके आधार पर पूरे कॉलेज अपार्टमेंट पैसे वाले पार्टी व्यापारी। तो हम लोग अभी चुनाव को मीटिंग करते थे में बीजेपी की दूसरी ताकि का चाक हो क्या जब सिकाई 240 तो हम हर महीने बाबी ठीक होती है वाली लेकिन इसलिए नहीं गीता पर चर्चा होती है उन्हें साथ मिलकर पूर्व प्रेम के आप शेखावाजी के रहने वाले को कहा आप कब?

455676,"
नमस्कार, Nashufammad के ख़ास program में आपका स्वागत है और मैं प्रज्ञा शाह. आज के इस ख़ास program में हम आपको एक ऐसे व्यक्ति से मिलवाने वाले हैं जो ना जाने कितने सालों से लोगों को सही राह पर चलाने का काम कर रहे हैं. आज जो मेरे साथ मौजूद हैं उनका नाम है आवाहन पीठाधीश्वर आचार्य अरुण गिरि जी महाराज. Sir बहुत स्वागत है आपका. आपका भी बहुत बहुत स्वागत धन्यवाद.

जी, और मेरे साथ अभी यहां पर जो है मौजूद हैं आचार्य मनीष जी, sir. Welcome sir. नमस्कार जी. मैं जानना चाहती हूं कि जैसे आप इतने सालों से लोगों को ज्ञान दे रहे हैं, उन्हें सही राह पर चलने के के जो है तरीके बता रहे हैं, लेकिन आज आप hims मेरठ में यहां मौजूद हैं, इसके पीछे का आखिर कारण क्या है? जो hims मेरठ है, यह भी एक अध्यात्मिक क्षेत्र है.

जी. यहां naturalpathy से लोगों को ठीक किया जाता है, यहां nature में रहने के लिए बताया जाता है. जो संत महापुरुष हमारे बताते थे हम लोगों को, वही चीज़ यहां आचार मनीष द्वारा यहां पर बताया जाता है. तो यह भी आश्रम है. इस आश्रम में आकर के हम रुद्रा, विषय, पूजा पाठ, ध्यान लोगों से, मरीज़ों से मिल रहा हूं, तो हर लोग यहां पर अच्छे ठीक हो रहे हैं तो natural patience से ठीक हो रहा है.

तो natural से ठीक होना जीवन में, यह भारत की सबसे बड़ी सफलता का यह यह केंद्र है, जो जाट साहब का हमारे हैं केंद्र है. तो यहां पर लोगों को आना चाहिए अंग्रेज़ी दवाई छोड़ा जाए, कैसे natural से ठीक हो, उसमें हर मनुष्य को ध्यान दिया जाए. इसलिए हम इस प्रांगण के अंदर आकर के हम भी कुछ इलाज करा रहे है, ऐसा नहीं है की मैं चाहे मैं भी उसका इलाज करा हूं, उसमें हमें भी बहुत आराम है उस इलाज में. क्या मैं जानकारी ले सकती हूं की वह दिक्कत क्या थी? नहीं कुछ नहीं, हमारे रहन सहन ठीक नहीं है, समय छूटना बैठना नहीं होता था.

उसके कारण बस थोड़ा sugar की problem हो गई. अच्छा. तो वह sugar यहां पर आकर के वह पूर्ण रूप से control हो गई. Control हो गई. क्या बोलेंगे, आचार्य चीज़ को लेकर?

देखो, actual में क्या होता है कि जब हम समाज में होते हैं, घर में होते हैं तो हमारा timing बिगड़ जाता है, आने जाने का तरीका बिगड़ जाता है, वही महाराज जी के साथ है और इन्होंने बड़े अच्छे, वैश्योय गुरु हैं हमारे, लेकिन एक student के रूप में इन्होंने हमने जो बातें बताई, वह actual में हमारे पूर्वज करते थे. जैसे शाम को छह बजे तक खाना खा लेना, नंगे पांव घास पर घूमना और फिर पानी खाने खाने के साथ नहीं पीना. अब महाराज जी का schedule ऐसा है कि सारे दिन कोई ना कोई VVIP, कोई ना कोई बड़े लोग, कोई ना कोई लोग मिलने आते रहते हैं, तो इनका अपना कोई schedule नहीं है, ना खाने का time है, ना पीने का time है, ना सोने का time है, कभी किसी मुख्यमंत्री से मिलने जा रहे हैं, कभी किसी मंत्री से मिलने जा रहे हैं, कभी वह आ रहा है, तो schedule बिगड़ा हुआ था. तो हमने कुछ नहीं करा सिर्फ schedule set करा है. उसी schedule को set करने से महाराज जी की sugar बिल्कुल normal आ गई है और basically जो मेरा इस him मेरठ में इनको बुलाने का मकसद था कि यहां आओ मिलो देखो लोगों से बात करो और इस चीज़ को पूरी दुनिया में प्रचार करो कि खाना पीना ठीक करके life style ठीक करके थोड़ा सा संतों की तरह रहकर जैसे हम यह यहां का environment आपको पता ही है वैसे बाबा जी का नाम environment बाबा भी है बड़े नाम से मशहूर environment बाबा के और इन्होंने दो हज़ार सोलह में कश्मीर से लेकर कन्याकुमारी तक पूरी पैदल यात्रा करी, उसके बाद इक्यावन लाख पेड़ लगाई और इन्होंने उस time बोला था कि दो हज़ार तीस तक वक्त आएगा कि लोग पीठ पर ना oxygen cylinder लेकर घूमेंगे और वह वक्त दो हज़ार उन्नीस में ही आ गया जो corona दो हज़ार बीस में corona ने लोगों को दुखी किया तो महाराज जी की भविष्यवाणी पहले से थी मैं तो महाराज जी को हर बारह तेरह साल से जुड़ा हुआ हूं लेकिन मैं इतना ज़रूर मानता हूं कि इन्होंने अपने तप के माध्यम से, अपने ज्ञान के माध्यम से, इस दुनिया को कल्याण करने के लिए एक किन चीज़ निकाल रखी है, एक चीज़ खोज रखी है.

बस इनके माध्यम से दुनिया तक पहुंचाना चाहते हैं और महाराज जी हमारी मदद भी कर रहे हैं, अभी बड़ी जल्दी हम दिल्ली में पूरे हिंदुस्तान में पैंतीस ऐसे patient जो लाइलाज बीमारियों से ग्रस्त थे उनको एक auditorium में पेश करने जा रहे हैं पूरी सरकार के सामने पूरे देश के सामने तो महाराज जी का अखाड़ा महाराज जी का पूरा का पूरा जो संस्था है, महाराज जी के जो पूरे followers हैं, वह हम सब, और यह सब इस काम में मदद कर रहे हैं. Sir, ने बताया, आपसे भी जानकारी ली कि environment बाबा. आखिर इसके पीछे आपका क्या मकसद रहा? आपने क्या वह लाख पेड़ लगाए? हम भी नहीं, हमारे सभी सहयोगियों ने मिलकर लगाया गया और उस यात्रा के दौरान जब वैष्णो देवी से कन्याकुमारी थी जो यात्रा थी उसमें सत्ताईस लाख पेड़ लगाए सब लोगों ने मिलकर के.

जी. तो चूंकि बचपन से मैं इस कार्य क्यों करता हूं, दो हज़ार दस से ही सब लोग मतलब प्रकृति क्रम में इतना ज़्यादा ध्यान दिया था तो सब लोग धीरे धीरे बोलते बोलते बोलते मेरा एक नाम ही डाल देते. तो environment बाबा नाम से लगे लोग पुकार रहे है लोगों ने, ये environment हमेशा काम करना. हमेशा रोज़ एक इस समय मेरे से नहीं हो रहा है, एक समय मैं रोज़ एक वृक्ष लगाता था. यह मेरा नियम था कहीं भी जाते थे एक पेड़ लगाते थे.

लेकिन इधर कुछ दिनों से मेरा छूटा हुआ है लेकिन जैसे अभी मेरी एक यात्रा फिर पुणे होने वाली है और ऋषिकेश से जो है कश्मीर तक, जम्मू कश्मीर तक और जो आदि गुरु शंकराचार्य की टेकरी है जितने सैनिक शहीद हो गए हैं, उनकी आत्मा की शांति के लिए और जो जन कल्याण मारे गए हैं. तो एक यात्रा एक हज़ार आठ कलश गंगा जल भर के हम लोग ले जाएंगे, आदि गुरु शंकराचार्य की टेकरी पर जो स्थापित शुरू है, महामृत्युंजय मंत्र द्वारा वहां पर जलाभिषेक करेंगे, उस दौरान एक लाख bridge लगाने का संकल्प है. और अगर मैं बात करूं आपके जो problem थी sugar के बारे में, यह कब से आपको हुई थी? दिनचर्या बिगड़ गई. दो हज़ार पंद्रह सोलह से बिगड़ गई तो बिगड़ गई और दिनचर्या ठीक कर दिया तो ठीक हो गई.

तो दिनचर्या ही तो ठीक करना है. चाचा भेज बताते है कि दिनचर्या को ठीक कर दिया जाए. इतनी भागम भाग दौड़ में और हम लोग भाग रहे हैं विज्ञान की तरफ, थोड़ा प्रकृति की तरफ अंदर जो है प्रकित बैठा है, साक्षात भगवान बैठा है, ईश्वर बैठा तो वह प्रकित को खोजता है ना. तो अब यहां आकर के तो एक दम रात साहब ने ऐसा routine डाल दिया मेरा. वह रहन सहन, खान, पियान, वह तो सब हो रहा था.

लेकिन वह timing set हो गया कि दिन से करना चाहिए हम आपको. पहले इनको modern Pathy की गोली लेकर भी इनकी दो सौ अस्सी, तीन सौ तीन सौ पचास तक चली आती थी. अभी हम रोज़ एक किलो आम खिला रहे हैं और modern pathy वाली गोली बंद हो गई है. उसके बावजूद इनकी बिल्कुल normal आती है. Normal, यह बहुत बड़े बात है कि insulin वगैरह भी ऐसा कुछ तो नहीं चल रही है.

जी जी जी जी जी. Tablet था अभी हमने इनको scanner भी लगाया हुआ है ताकि चौदह दिन बाद जब वह scanner से भी रोज़ scan करके किस खाने से इनकी बढ़ती घटती है. इनको भी पूरा वह training देंगे ताकि इनके जो शिष्य हैं क्योंकि भारत में सत्ताईस लाख साधु संत समाज है उनमें भी कईयों को sugar है कईयों को dialysis चल रहा है कईयों के treatment चल रहा है जैसे अभी pilot बाबा हैं उनका dialysis चल रहा है तो pilot बाबा अठारह तारीख को हमारे इसी hemes में admit होने के लिए आ रहे पायलट बाबा अपने आप में बहुत बड़े संत हैं और Russia में रसिया जैसी country में लगभग उन्होंने पंद्रह लाख लोगों को भगवा बनाया और वहां के लोगों को convert किया जो कि हमारी सनातन को मानते हैं तो पायलट बाबा eighteen तारीख उनको खुद को डायलिसिस चल रहा है तो अठारह तारीख को आ रहे हैं मां किसी को कोलेस्ट्रोल है किसी को आठ की problem है हमने सबको बोला है कि हमारी तरफ से सबके दरवाज़े आपके welcome के लिए खुले रहेंगे क्योंकि हमारा सौभाग्य है कि ऐसी महान विभूतियों के चरण हमारे यहां पड़ेंगे. बिल्कुल बिल्कुल. कितने दिन आपको यहां पर sir आए हुए हो चुके हैं?

हां, तीसरा दिन मुझे है. तीसरा. हां, तीसरा दिन, अब सबसे बड़ी बात है कि doctor साहब ने बोला है कि संतों का जो निशंक सेवा है मैं वह करूंगा. यह बहुत बड़ी बात है, यह आश्रम है, संतों के बारे में, जाट साहब ने ऐसा सोचा ऐसा संकल्प लिया, तो यह बहुत बड़ी चीज़ है. तमाम संत ऐसे है की बेचारे जो परेशान है उनके पास व्यवस्थाएं नहीं है की वह इलाज करा सके, तो जो आना चाहे गढ़ साहब ने ऐसा बोला है घूम कर के वक्त किया जाएगा.

यह एक बहुत अच्छी चीज़ है मनीष जी की मतलब संतों के लिए मतलब बिना किसी उसके. यह इसके बारे में क्या कहेंगे? यह विचार कहां से आया है? मैं बताना चाहूंगा. जी.

पिछले काफी time से हम, मैं doctor BRC हमारी team HIV का कोई भी patient contact करता है, हम कोई पैसा नहीं लेते. Tally senior का कोई भी बच्चा contact करता है, हम कोई पैसा नहीं लेते और सन् समाज से कोई भी हमारे पास आएगा तो हमारी तरफ से इनका इनका हम क्या इनको देंगे निशुल्क तो क्या कहेंगे इनका यह क्या करेंगे इनका आशीर्वाद उल्टा मिलेगा कि हम इस mission में जो हमारा mission है पूरा भारत स्वस्थ हो जाए हर व्यक्ति अपना doctor खुद वन जाए kidney fail है liver fail है cancer है thalassemia है और या heart problem है हर चीज़ का इलाज हमारी body में मौजूद है उस ज्ञान को दुनिया तक पहुंचाना उसके लिए मैं सबसे ज़्यादा संत समाज की है क्योंकि इनकी बात लोग सुनते हैं लोग इनको भगवान की तरह गुरु की तरह पूछते हैं तो लोग फिर इनकी बात को follow भी करते हैं अगर यह बोलेंगे कि मैं एक किलो आम खा रहा हूं रोज़ के और मेरी sugar नहीं बढ़ रही है मैं अकेला खा रहा हूं चीकू खा रहा हूं तो दुनिया विश्वास करेगी एक बहुत बड़ी बात है अभी थोड़ी देर पहले जो हमारे पूरे मैं India में cgHS director हैं वह भी मिलकर गई हैं उनके husband को भी खुद doctor है वह मिलकर गए हैं ऐसे कितने ही शिष्य हैं महाराज जी के जो पूरी दुनिया में फैले हुए हैं वह बार बार महाराज जी से पुछ रहे महाराज जी आप बताओ हम कब आए हम कब आए तो वह महाराज जी का इंतज़ार करें कि महाराज जी इनको हरी झंडी है और वह पहुंचे महाराज जी अभी तीन दिन के लिए जो हमारा seventy two घंटे का camp लगता है कि क्यों rate of seventy two महाराज जी उसका हिस्सा बने और उन्होंने यहां की सारी सुविधाओं को जांचा पूरा campus देखा इनको बहुत पसंद आया तो अब इन्होंने सात दिन और रुकने का निर्णय लिया है तो हम यहां इनका हमें भी खुशी है कि रुकें और फिर अठारह तारीख से यह पंद्रह दिन के लिए आ रहे हैं.

यह और pilot बाबा. हम पूरी कोशिश करेंगे कि उनका dialysis कम करने की या बंद करवाने की हम जितनी हमसे कोशिश हो पाएगी और महाराज जी से भी हम यह appeal करेंगे कि पूरे देश में जितना संत समाज है या जितने ऐसे लोग हैं जो निस्वार्थ देश की सेवा में लगे हुए हैं उनसे हम लोगों का message वहां तक पहुंचे और हम इस जो एक हज़ार bed का Asia का सबसे बड़ा hospital है शुदी gram मेरठ यह है डेराबस्ती वाला है लखनऊ वाला है Mumbai वाला हमसे जितनी सेवा हो पाएगी हम करेंगे. महाराज जी, मैं आपसे जानना चाहूंगी यहां पर जो therapies वगैरह है, जो diet दी जा रही है. वह diet कैसी है, therapy कैसी है क्योंकि मैंने बहुत patient से बात की. अब मैं आपसे भी इस बारे में जानकारी दे देती हूं.

नहीं, जो सब प्राकृतिक है, सब प्राकृतिक organic, प्राकृतिक है organic है और जिन चीज़ों को मैंने छोड़ दिया था कि नहीं खाऊंगा, डांट साहब वही खिला रहे है बड़ा आनंद आ रहा है. हमने कहा बैठा हूं खा रहा हूं. आम खाना छोड़ दीजिए, केला खाना छोड़ दिए थे और इसी तरह सब कुछ छूट गया था, मिठाई छूट गई थी. थोड़ा सा बैठा के मुझे बड़े प्रेम से खिलाते हैं कि गुरुदेव आप खाइए इसको और कुछ नहीं होता और मैं आराम से खाता हूं और मैं एकदम normal हूं. हमारे करीबन तीन सौ तक sugar होते थे.

तो आज मैं इस समय normal स्थिति में मैं हूं. कोई दवा नहीं ले रहा हूं और मैं आनंद से हूं यहां पर अभी. लेकिन इसके पीछे कारण क्या है? आप सब कुछ, सब कुछ खिलाते हैं. इसके पीछे बड़ा कारण है?

हम सब कुछ खाने के लिए बने हुए हैं, लेकिन गलत खाने के लिए नहीं बने हुए. हम जहर खाने के लिए नहीं बने chemical खाने के लिए बने आज इतना pesticide्स यूज हो रहा है और जो पका हुआ भोजन है जैसे गेहूं हम खाते रोटी खाते हैं हम उसका ग्लाइसेमिक index बहुत ही है हम चावल खाते उसका ग्लाइसेमिक index बहुत ही है बदले में उसी और minutes खिला रहे हैं जो कि मोटे राज्यों two thousand twenty three भारत में अंतरराष्ट्रीय minute year बनाया जा रहा है तो हमारे minute ही बनता है salad फ्रूट नारियल पानी juice वह सब पिलाते हैं juice में हल्दी ढलती है अदरक डलता है तो महाराज जी बोलते भी हैं मेरे को. ऐसे वह बोल रहे थे कि यहां का जैसा juice तो मैंने कभी पिया ही नहीं क्योंकि यहां के juice में खाली चुकंदर नहीं है. चुकंदर, उसके अलावा हल्दी, आंवला, अदरक यह सब चीज़ें कड़ी पत्ता यह सब चीज़ें डली में फिर juice बना. वाह, और जो दूसरे लोग अब हमारे जो viewers देख रहे हैं, जो patient भी हैं, उनके लिए आपका एक संदेश जो मैं लेना चाहूंगा.

मैं तो जो लोग इस खान पीयन से जिनके रोग बढ़ गए हैं, बिगड़ गए हैं, अंग्रेज़ी दवाइयां खा रहे हैं. वह यहां इस स्थान पर बैठक आचार्य मनीष जी के प्रांगण में आए और सुध शुद्ध रूप से यहां पर भगवान का मंदिर बना है, आरती होती है, पूजा होती है. तो पूरा एक तरह आश्रम का माहौल है, यहां बच्चे भी पढ़ते हैं, उनको संस्कृति सिखाई जाती है, सभ्यता सिखाती है, अति संस्कार सिखाई जाती है. तो लोग यहां अपने को ठीक भी करें और शाम को वहां पर भजन पूजा, आनंद से सब करें मंदिर भी है. मंदिर भी है.

मंदिर भी है और school भी है और सब बच्चे निशुल्क पढ़ते हैं सब पढ़ते हैं. जितना staff इस hospital में काम करता है, उनके बच्चों से पढ़ने की कोई fees नहीं ले जाती और लड़कियों का और छोटे बच्चों का निशुल्क school चलता है यहां पर और सबसे बड़ी बात है आसपास के कुछ गांव के लोग भी. जी. वह भी यहां free पड़ते हैं. हम किसी से कोई पैसा नहीं लेते.

सबसे बड़ी बात है यह सेवा है इस देश में क्रांति लाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं और मैं महाराज जी से last में बोलूंगा एक appeal भी करता हूं और एक चीज़ पहले पूछूंगा अभी आपसे. आपने तीन दिन जो session attend किया बहत्तर घंटे का, doctor BRC का session attend किया, आपको उस session में नया क्या लगा? कुछ different क्या लगा? नहीं देखिए, नया तो इससे सब प्राचीन चीज़ जो हम भूल गए थे, उन्होंने उसी को circle को घुमा दिया. ठीक ना?

तो जैसे हम लोग कहते थे की भाई lam train में रहा जाए, हम यह रहे, वह रहे, बिजली कम से कम उपयोग किया जाए और प्राकृतिक प्रकाश है उसको लिया जाए. यह सब हम सब लोगों ने छोड़ दिया था. मतलब हम तो कर ही रहे थे. मतलब सब में, सब में आ गए, तो हम भी उसी संसार में आए. तो जैसे आप जैसे बैठी है अपने आप ही में हम गए तो सब black शीशा है तो हम भी आपके साथ इसी तरह हो गए.

लेकिन हम ऋषिकेश में रह के इसी तरह प्राकृतिक जीवन को जीता हूं अभी भी. लेकिन पूर्व से कैसे खान पीन किया गया, क्या खाया जाए, रहा जाए, जिससे रोग पूरा प्रवेश शरीर में ना हो, जो स्वस्थ है वह पहले ही यह इलाज करें, जीवन भर स्वस्थ ही होकर जाएंगे देव लोक में. तो मैं सबसे ही appeal करूंगा कि इस चीज़ को अपने जीवन में हम लोग उसको उतार लिया जाए. अपनी दिनचर्या अच्छी हो और सब कुछ अच्छा रख लिया जाए. तो निश्चित है, lifestyle और संस्कार, संस्कृति, सभ्यता सबको ठीक कर लिया जाए.

इस प्रांगण में आके सब ठीक हो जाएगा. प्रात या पांच बजे लोग उठ जाते हैं यहां पर, सबको उठा दिया जाता है. तो सभी ठीक हो रहा है ना जिसे लगता है कि दम आश्रम में है. अच्छा यार, दूध भी मिला है, लस्सी भी मिली है लेकिन नारियल के दूध की, चटनी मिली, बादाम के दूध की मूंगफली के दूध की चीज़ें मिली है दही खिलाई लस्सी पिलाई है तो सब अलग अलग इनको गाय भैंस के दूध की जगह हमने दूसरे दूध पर डाला और उसकी दही पर डाला और महाराज जी बड़ा प्रसन्न हुए इसका test देखकर कि बड़ा यह क्या अच्छा test है उसका लगा? यह कुछ नया सुनने के लिए मिल रहा है कि ऐसी चीज़ें भी यहां पर.

वह पानी का दूध बादाम का दूध नारियल का दूध उनकी ही नहीं उसी की लस्सी वह हमने यहां पर हमारे इस बहत्तर घंटे के हैं वह सर होती है और सबसे ज़्यादा लोगों से मिलो patient से मिलो हमारे hospital में आता ही वही है जिसको सारी दुनिया से जवाब मिल जाता है. Kidney fail, liver fail, cancer, heart problem अभी आप सामने वाले room में देखोगे तो एक आबू दाबी से patient आए हुए हैं. उनका पैर पूरा गला हुआ है और impputation हो चुका है. Doctor ने काटने के लिए बोला है कि इसका पैर कटेगा और आपको मैं challenge कर रहा हूं पंद्रह बीस दिन लगेंगे हमें सात दिन हो चुके हैं. उनका ज़ख्म काफी हद तक हमने heal कर लिया.

पंद्रह बीस दिन और लगेंगे हम उनका पैर कटने नहीं देंगे. यह आयुर्वेद की शक्ति हम दुनिया को दिखाना चाहते हैं. अब वह अबू धाबी से उनको रोज़ के पांच छह phone आते हैं. क्या हुआ? क्या हुआ?

वह रोज़ photo भेजती है अपने ससुराल को, अपने मायके को कि आज पहले से ज़ख्म भर रहा है, बस सूखने लग गई है, रंग काला था वह वापस लाल होने लग गया है तो यह चमत्कार है लेकिन सभी diet से होते हैं Lifestyle से होते हैं नंगे पांव घास पर घूमने अर्थिंग से होते हैं जो हम जीरो वाट की बात करते हैं तो सब कुछ natural हमारे hospital में करते हैं और महाराज जी का में पूरा सहयोग है महाराज जी ने मुझे वादा किया है कि अब अगले कुछ साल जब तक महाराज जी इस धरती पर विराजमान रहेंगे उन्होंने बोला कि मैं आयुर्वेद के लिए, naturopathy के लिए जितनी मदद हो पाएगी संत समाज की तरफ से मैं करूंगा क्योंकि इस विद्या को पूरे विश्व में फैलाना है. बिल्कुल बिल्कुल. बहुत शुक्रिया आचार्य जी आपको. महाराज जी आप दोनों का बहुत शुक्रिया. Thank you so much.

एक यज्ञ. एक संदेश है. एक संदेश है. आप पहले संदेश दे दो, फिर तेईस July वाला message भी दे देना चाहिए. जी.

यज्ञ ही जीवन है, जीवनी यज्ञ सांसे हो रही है कम, आओ पेड़ लगाए हम, सभी लोग ध्यान दें दो दो वृक्षारोपण किया जाए. बीजारोपण से लेके पौधारोपण तक. मनुष्य यह करे कि हम जो आम खाते हैं जो season का फ़ल खाते हैं तो अपने गमलों में दो चार वृक्ष को लगाया जाए और लगा कर के उसको बड़ा किया जाए. जैसे आप डाक से प्रेम करते हैं, कुत्तों से, लोग ऐसी उसूलाते हैं, वो सिवा कोई oxygen शुद्ध नहीं देते हैं. तो आप अपने गमलों में वृक्ष लगाए उससे प्रेम करें.

जब वह bridge दो साल का हो जाए तो कोई अच्छा यह स्थान पर ले जाकर उसको स्थापित कर दे लगा दे एक बार. यही मेरा दुनिया को संदेश है. यज्ञ ही जीवन है, जीवन ही यज्ञ है, सांसे हो रही है कम. आओ पेड़ लगाए हम और डर साहब का मेरे तेईस तारीख को जो है तेईस July को camp है दिल्ली में. उस camp में आप सभी लोग सादर आमंत्रित हैं और website पर उस व्यवस्थाएं चल रही है तो उसको देख ले कैसे उसके अंदर entry होनी है और जीवन को पद्धति को प्राकृतिक रूप से बदलने का हम लोग संकल्प लिया जाए कि स्वस्थ रहे.

जब स्वस्थ रहेंगे तभी इस राष्ट्र को कुछ दिया जा सकता है. वह अच्छा सा इस gram में doctor आचार्य मनीष जी के द्वारा एक देश में दिया जा रहा है, हम भी उसका प्रचार प्रसार करने का एक सोच रहा हूं की एक अच्छा सा हिस्सा बनो की लोग आज तक जीवन जीने की जो सही कला है, खाने कला है यहां से इस समय प्राप्त होता है. बहुत बहुत साधुवाद. Thank you so much. धन्यवाद.

तो यह थे हमारे साथ महाराज जी और आचार्य मनीष जी. जानकारी बहुत महत्वपूर्ण है और जो भी appeal की गई है वह भी महत्वपूर्ण है और इसी के साथ इस साक्षात्कार को हम यहीं विराम देते हैं. ऐसे ही interviews के लिए national खबर के साथ बने रहिए.

जो यज्ञ है, वही अग्नि है और जो अग्नि है, वही नारायण है, जो नारायण है, वही सूर्य है. यज्ञ ही दाता है संसार का, सृष्टि का रचना, यज्ञ ही करता है. सर्वस जीवों का पालन पोषण यज्ञ के माध्यम से होता है. जो अध्यात्म है वह आत्मा है और जो आत्मा है वही अध्यात्म है. लेकिन अब आत्मा किसी दिशा में कार्य कर रही है वह मनुष्य के ऊपर बहुत निर्भर करता है.

यज्ञ आत्मा को शुद्धिकरण करता है और जब आत्मा ही शुद्धिकरण हो जाएगा तो निश्चित है कि मनुष्य की प्रवृत्ति वह बदल जाएगी और जब तक मनुष्य की प्रवृत्ति नहीं बदलेगी जीवन में तब तक इस संसार में चाहे कितनो अध्यात्म की प्रचार प्रसार किया जाए और मनुष्य के अंदर शुद्धिकरण नहीं होगा तो उसके ऊपर कोई असर नहीं पड़ता है. यज्ञ क्या करता है? आत्मा को शुद्धिकरण करता है. यज्ञ सर्वस्थ पर्यावरण को शुद्ध करता है. यज्ञ की जो आहुति दी जाती है देवताओं तक जाती है और जब देवताओं को जो आहुति दी जाती है मंत्रों द्वारा तो देवता जब प्रसन्न होके प्रबल होते हैं इस मृत लोक में सभी मानव के कल्याण के लिए आशीर्वाद देते हैं.

तमाम रोग फैले हैं. लोग कहते हैं कि यज्ञ करिए, कपूर जलाइए, धूप जलाइए, तमाम जड़ी बूटियां औषधियां और सदियां यज्ञ में डाली जाती हैं और उससे नाशिका के माध्यम से शरीर के अंदर प्रवेश करता है. तो जैसी भी प्रभावित आत्माएं के अंदर दुष्ट ग्रहण हो या रोग ग्रहण हो गया हो शरीर के अंदर तो यज्ञ के माध्यम से वह सब स्वाहा हो जाता है, समाप्त हो जाता है, उसका नाश हो जाता है. है. यज्ञ एक बड़ा महत्वपूर्ण चीज़ है.

यज्ञ सभी मनोकामनाओं का पूर्ति करता है. जैसे अग्नि आप जला दें तो जो आपकी मन की इच्छा हो वैज्ञानिक तौर पर अग्नि जला दे जो आपकी मन की इच्छा हो उसे अग्नि के ऊपर पकवान जो चाहे वो आप पका सकते हैं उसी तरह यज्ञ जीवन में मनुष्य के भाग लिए जो उसकी अंतरात्मा में जो मनोकामना है यज्ञ पूर्ण करता है राजा दशरथ को भी यज्ञ के ही शरण में जाना पड़ा उनको जब पुत्र की इच्छा हुई तो आज के युग में मैं सबसे कहता हूं की आपकी मनोकामना पूर्ण सिर्फ यज्ञ कर सकता है और संसार में कोई ऐसी चीज़ नहीं जो आपकी मनोकामना पूर्ण करें जिस अभिलाषा से जिस यज्ञ अनुष्ठान को आप करते हैं वह मनोकामना यज्ञ नारायण भगवान सिद्ध करते हैं जैसे आप घर में अग्नि जलाते हैं और जिस main की इच्छा खाने की इच्छा होती है मनुष्य की जी व्यापर उसे तरह के पकवान पाक जाते हैं उसी तरह भाग्य उदय होता है यज्ञ से जो आपकी इच्छा यज्ञ करेंगे वो मनोकामना पहुंच जाएगी जो यज्ञ है वह अनंत है और अनंत की व्याख्या को करना बड़ा कठिन काम है, जैसे शिव की व्याख्या कोई क्या कर सकता है? जो अग्नि है वो अनंत है.

जो पता है पहले जो अग्नि है और वही यज्ञ है और जो यज्ञ है वही नारायण है, जो नारायण है वही सूर्य है, जो सूर्य है वही अग्नि है तो यह तो अनंत है अनंत कीते व्याख्या हम घास कर सकते हैं मनुष्य की प्रवृत्ति जो है खत्म हो गए देखिए यज्ञ खत्म नहीं हुआ है यज्ञ पूरे विश्व में आज भी होता है यह हमारी अपनी सोच है क्योंकि बिना अग्नि का यज्ञ हो नहीं सकता है और यज्ञ सबके घर में अग्नि जल रही है और सभी लोग यह बसंत इतना है की मंत्र रूपी अग्नि नहीं जल रही है पकवान रूपी अग्नि जल रही है इसलिए जो है जब प्राचीन कल में यज्ञ होते the तो अग्नि जला के ही होते the और आज भी यज्ञ हो रहा है तो अग्नि को जला के होता है तो लुप्त नहीं हुआ है लेकिन मंत्र नहीं पढ़ा जा रहा है उससे मन की इच्छा की जो भोजन है वह प्राप्ति की जा रही है अग्नि जब लुप्त हो जाएगा तो पुरी सृष्टि प्रलय हो जाएगी लेकिन जो परेशानियां हैं अग्नि जल रही है लेकिन मंत्र रूपी अग्नि नहीं जल रही है तो सभी के घर में मंत्र रूपी अग्नि जल है और उसके बाद उसके ऊपर पकवान पनपाइए तो देवताओं तक पहुंच जाएगा.

थोड़ी अग्नि को भेंट कर दीजिए. आज से पच्चीस तीस साल पहले यज्ञ बहुत होते थे हमारे देश में. अब लोग पश्चिमी सभ्यता को ही पालन करने लगे हैं लोग और इसलिए यज्ञ लुप्त नहीं हुआ है यह खुद लोगों के परिवार में जो गार्जियन लोग हैं माता पिता हैं उनको इस बच्चों को संस्कार में डालना चाहिए की आप यज्ञ करिए. कुछ ना तो गुरु मन से ही यज्ञ करिए. ना तो माता पिता के नाम से ही स्वाहा कार्य करिए.

कर यज्ञ को भेट करिए, प्रणाम करिए. देखिए आकृति भवन उनकी अलग अलग है और बड़ा इस पर विस्तार किया जाए लेकिन मन की आकृति जो है श्रद्धा पूर्वक हो वह किसी दिशा में कहीं भी बैठ के आप भगवान को अग्नि देवता को स्वाहा स्वाहा दीजिए प्रेम से आपकी मनोकामना पूर्ण हो जाएगी आकृति में मत फंसिए मनुष्य को हमेशा अपनी प्रवृत्ति को आत्मा को परमात्मा में फंसा करके स्वाहा कार्य आपको संपूर्ण लाभ पूर्ण मिलेगा. जगह मनुष्य की जो भाव है और वो मन है वह परमात्मा के प्रति शुद्ध रूप से निष्ठा विश्वास में हो आप किसी भी दिशा में किसी भी रूप में बिना कुंड में सर बैंगनी जला के ही स्वाहा कर दीजिए आपको मिले प्राचीन कल में ऋषि मुनि जंगलों में कहीं भी हवन करते the और जिस अवस्था में जिस कल में जिस व्यवस्था होते the वह संसार और राज के hit के लिए कार्य करता था ऐसे एक व्यक्ति अपने जीवन के दिनचर्या की सुंदरता बड़े main से करता है और उसी तरह अपने जीवन के दिनचर्या में यज्ञ को भी धारण कर ले की यह भी हमारे दिनचर्या में है जैसे एक दिन भोजन नहीं करता आदमी तो बड़ा परेशान हो जाता है उसी तरह मनुष्य को अपने दिनचर्या में ही यज्ञ को धारण कर लो और आप यज्ञ नहीं करोगे तो परेशान रहोगे भोजन किसी समय करते हैं या भूख लगती है एक घंटा आगे या पीछे उसी तरह जब दिनचर्या में आप धारण कर लेंगे तो परमात्मा जानते हैं की यह मनुष्य व्यस्त है यह जो है हमारे कार्य को किसी वक्त ज़रूर करेगा और समय की कोई बाध्यता ना हो आप रोज़ अपने दिनचर्या में डालेंगे निश्चित है परमात्मा आपको प्राप्ति हो जाएगी जो मेरे भाव जो मेरे जीवन के अनुभव है यज्ञ मनुष्य किसी भी विधि से किसी भी वक्त कर सकता है.

और उसकी परिपूर्ण व्यवस्था उसकी मन की अंतरात्मा शुद्ध होनी चाहिए. वह बड़ा महत्वपूर्णता है और अंतरात्मा अगर आपका शुद्ध नहीं है तो आप कितनों वस्तु में यज्ञ कुंड को बनाकर आप रखेंगे और आप भगवान के नाम से उसमें कितनी स्वाकार करिए, परमात्मा आपके ऊपर कभी प्रसन्न नहीं होगा क्योंकि आपके मन के अंदर ही खोट है. जब आचार्य गुरु लोग उपस्थित होते हैं जहां यज्ञ होता है तो वह पूरे नियमावली से कराते हैं. पूरे नियम के तहत कराते हैं, पूरी विधि विधान से और पूरे शास्त्र से उसको कराते हैं. लेकिन जहां संत महापुरुष नहीं है, विद्वान लोग नहीं है.

जहां भक्ति प्रवेश है शिव परमात्मा के प्रति पूर्ण रूप से शरणागति है, विसर्जित है तो वह किसी दिशा में किसी भी भाव में करेगा उसको पुण्य मिलेगा क्योंकि वह व्यक्ति नहीं जानता है. जो व्यक्ति नहीं जानता है, जाने में कोई उससे दोष होता है, उसे दोष नहीं लगता है. जैसे गुरु और ब्राह्मण आचार्य जानते हैं, वह उस नियमों का शास्त्र का उल्लंघन करते हैं, तो दोषी वह हैं गुरु और आचार्य ना किसी से जन्म होते हैं शिष्यों को कभी नहीं घबराना चाहिए किसी भी दिशा में अच्छे ढंग से भाव से यज्ञ करना चाहिए उन्हें. ऋषि मुनियों ने अपनी आत्मा को ईश्वर के प्रति बाण लेते थे और जब एक दूसरे से जब बंध जाते हैं तो निश्चित है दो में या तो हमको ईश्वर प्राप्त होगा या तो हम ईश्वर को प्राप्त हो जाएंगे और उसी नियम का पालन मनुष्य को करना चाहिए. सिर्फ मेरे अपने भाव और अपने विचार हैं.

किसी भी संविधान से लकड़ी से आप हवन करें, आपको पूर्ण फ़ल मिलता है. मन बहुत ही शुद्ध होना चाहिए, मैं बार बार कहता हूं कि अगर मन शुद्ध नहीं है तो हम चंदन की लकड़ी से भी अगर हवन करते हैं तो हमें वह लाभ नहीं मिलेगा, मन शुद्ध होकर के पवित्र अग्नि जलानी चाहिए. अग्नि जो है पवित्र रखनी चाहिए, यह हमेशा ध्यान देना चाहिए. जहां हम अग्नि को जलाएं, वह स्थान साफ सुथरा होना चाहिए बस."

Speaker 2  (00:04)
ठीक है। 

Speaker 3  (00:07)
तो महाराज नहीं। लेकिन अगर आपको उचित लगे तो मैं मतलब कुछ साधारण प्रश्न पूछूंगा अगर आपको अच्छी लगे तो उसका उत्तर दे सकते हैं। 

Speaker 2  (00:19)

देखिए अब जलवायु परिवर्तनीय तो अभी देखिए यहां पर सऊदी 1000000000 में जहां कभी पानी होता ही नहीं है। 

Speaker 3  (01:41)
ये चीजिए महाराज की जैसे हम सब सनातन धर्म की बात करते हैं हम अध्यात्म की बात करते हैं हम और एक तरफ है जो भौतिक सुख और जैसे कि जलवायु परिवर्तन है यह भी भौतिक सुख का ही हिस्सा है क्योंकि आत्मा और शरीर में अंतर होता है। 

Speaker 2  (02:01)
यही तो है एक दैहिक शरीर का भौतिक। दैनिक टाइप। 

Speaker 1  (02:09)
एक दैविक नैतिक तापा देवताओं का भी ऐसे घर के नाम से। 

Speaker 2  (02:13)
ये 3 ताप है क्लेश है। 

Speaker 3  (02:17)
तो वही मतलब तो जैसे जो क्लाइमेट चेंज का जो प्रश्न है क्या यह सनातन धर्म या या इस महाकुंभ में मुझे इसका प्रश्न खोजने की जरूरत भी है क्योंकि शरीर तो नश्वर है हमें गर्मी लग रही है या बरसात ज्यादा हो रही है इसलिए हम उसको खोज रहे हैं तो क्या ये मेरा प्रश्न पूछना भी? जायज है सही है। 

Speaker 2  (02:36)
ठीक है ये तो प्रश्न पूछा ही जा रही है मगर आत्मव्व्यवहार नहीं अध्यात्म एक जीवन जीने के अपने अंतरात्मा में उन्हें पूरे ही अलग है जब लेकिन वह कला जो है हमारे शास्त्र महापुरुषों से आती जिसे जो शरका मिले प्रयास जल प्रवाह कहते हैं में जीने की सलाह एक कितना? तेज जितना बहाव होगा उतना ही भक्ति अब फुरफुर फरी बहाया उससे कई गुना ताक़त वाले हाथी जो है वो बहे जा रहे हैं।

Speaker 3  (04:46)
महाराज जैसे महाकुंभ है साल में होता है हर साल मेला भी लगता है और आप लोग कई साल से इसको देखते आ रहे हैं। तो किस पर प्रकार का परिवर्तन महसूस कर रहे हैं? मतलब कुछ सुधार हुआ है महाकुंभ के परिपेक्ष। 

Speaker 2  (05:02)

वो तो यह देखने आते हैं कि मैनेजमेंट होता है ये सोच क्या है? दूसरी बात यह रहे हैं कि हम अगर निमंत्रण देंगे किसी को प्रोत्साहित करेंगे या प्रलोभन देंगे तो भी कोई नहीं आता निमंत्रण है न प्रलोभन।

आप लेकिन पहले से ज्यादा जान रहे हैं उसको आप सुबह सुबह सुबह सुबह सुबह सुबह होने के बिगड़ न आए तो उसके बिगड़ने के सारे कार्यक्रम इसी में हैं। आपके प्रश्न का उत्तर जी को सुनेंगे तो ये आपको किसी पत्र में ले जाएगा। इसलिए आप बुरा देखना शुरू करेंगे तो गिरावट आती है तो दोष काम बताइए यह दुनिया है ये पूरी दुनिया यह संसार ही है। अब आपने क्या लेना है? आपने लेकिन आप लिखे? 

Speaker 2  (06:03)
एक चीज़ एक चीज़ और उसके आगे बात कर रहा हूं जिससे इसके ऊपर एक नियंत्रण है। ट्राई ट्राई ने ये नियम बनाया कि ऐसा होना चाहिए वैसा होना चाहि शासन प्रशासन जो होता है वो कहीं न कहीं से उसके ऊपर नियंत्रण के लिए नियंत्रण किसका होगा सारी दुनिया है लेकिन अगर महाराज जी ने कुछ कह दिया। तो आपके लिए ब्रह्मा की लकीर के बराबर है। हमारे लिए बहुमत के लकीर के बराबर है अगर हम मानते हैं अगर हम दूसरों को मानता तो उनका कहा हमारी ब्रह्मा की लगी तो एक मान्यता तो है तो क्या ऐसे महात्माओं को या शासन को मैं महात्मा की बात इसमें सामने बोल दिए? 

Speaker 2  (06:41)
मैं प्रशासन के लिए बात कर रहा हूँ कि शासन की नजर में क्या सब? लोगों को एक नजर से देखना चाहिए या ये तो मेरा प्रिय सही मेरा बहुत। खातेदारी करता है। इसका थोड़ा अलग-अलग होता है। 

Speaker 1  (06:56)
राजा को भगवान बोला गया है राजनीति में। उन्होंने कहा कि सारी प्रजा के हिसाब से यथार्थ जैसी है उसको वैसा उसका हर का ख्याल रखना हर एक कुछ करें तो ये उसमें फिर आगे क्या होता है कि जैसे सब चीजों का जवाब है कि आपके 5 बेटे है ना? तो 5 बेटे को डीसी बन जाता है उसका कम क्या अपना समझ आ रहा है करना एक। बोला है सुबह शाम आपकी सेवा करता है। तो कहीं न कहीं वो डिफरेंस आपके घर में ही? 

Speaker 2  (07:31)
ऑटोमेटिक।

Speaker 1  (00:26)
Today, also organic gardening encyclopaedia, we read all of these books on organic guys think we were doing everything we could. Yes, and it was working. The crops were drawing, we met a man from the Philippines who told us how to rotate the crops you know in code, so every you give 1/4 shade, 1/4 rolling 1 corner herb is one for the sound you switch around like that. 

Speaker 1  (00:50)
That way, you always have fresh dirt to be planning and so we got very good at we, we couldn't seller or give it away all on the big island that is a, which was laking ceremony for long ago? And so II said, okay, if I had a file exlicense, I could fly produce. The horrible and to a friend's place. 

Speaker 1  (01:10)
You have a store. One now, which was about an hour and a 1/2 almost 2 hours late, I have smoked, so I approached my Father and I shall I show my medication when you left, could I use it to get a pilot of slice during roll? If these are personal ranges things? 

Speaker 1  (01:26)
During World War 2, my Father, when he was young, wanted to be a fighter, pilot. Wow, when he went to the do the test, he gone into the altitude chamber and he had signed his problems that he black out so he couldn't be a pilot life is wanted to be when his Son finally said. Oh I like to be a pilot. 

Speaker 1  (01:45)
Oh, this is wonderful, so he was paying for my education back then, the devotees was very much a thing of the devotee saying. The only devotion that we can do is Chandigarh Krishna in the street or distributing books. That's it, and so when I was in Los Angeles and finishing my flying answer, so I was doing my commercial in my instrument so that I could get my licences, I would go to the temple every morning and I would offer to the dates what I was going to do that when I finish my classes, I'll go back to the list and I tell them what I did. 

Speaker 1  (02:24)
But the body is in a temple can open your mind. Your mind would be going to help you're an illusion. You shouldn't be doing this, just please come samples, then I kept telling them like, I believe it's devotional and and so finally, I got an audio and social is a soapy tape recorder.

Speaker 1  (03:17)
Are you doing person and I said, I said, yes, I believe I said was an extraversion service. Yes, because it's unchat it's what's coming from our heart and why we're doing it? So if everyone of us dead, your that's lot in mind, I'm doing the very best I can do not so that I can get rich.

Wow about Krishna, and this is this is the age because you pick away from such a gift. If they, if the people, the rest of the people overall understood what a gift it was to be born in modern worship, what a counsel gift for us, we struggle all the time before again.

It is because you are constantly learned. Yes, how do I what you know. 

Speaker 3  (12:49)
Yes, every time you get a special case, there are some complication. 

Speaker 1  (12:52)
And so what you're doing is every time you get a special place every time you see an opportunity to say, okay, how do I make this bear at the very least for yourself? Saying, how do I do this to give it to Krishna am by just that app Bixby make a share show. Instead of Monday, whether it's 16 or not, if every morning you're getting outside Krishna, this is what you've given me to do.

We started translating about the time and again he was dancing out his translations in talking about Krishna and he factors you baby can societies, they attract other people. There's so much about the slow method, just the share thing distributing to Sharam, which is rude after the Krishna near working. You know whatever eye can do, anybody imports, and this alone like standing on Australia? 

Speaker 1  (14:31)
But my friend saying, hurry Krishna. 

Speaker 3  (14:34)
That is, your venubrata is or nirmalta is a word in Hindi, which means that you are so ground toward that you're not even considering that you are doing something really out of the box, but actually you are.

Unfortunately, it's a part of a gathering of human service thing that if you don't think you don't very you have that chance, oh, getting Uber reactive and so people you know, I understand a lot of people who are attending for very, very small education, if any so, but a very great devotion, I all want to get there at the same time and where I push indication. It's like I'm happy that you drove one of the time to touch the card, but if you outcome once I have to push you because you hurts about.

Absolutely, what do you think about the curb and can't like water like? There are so many spiritual gurus and saints in mahator who are only related to the physical aspects of devotion, yes, the this thing less the pujas and everything, so how seriously do you think that that is going to? Help us achieve the Krishna.

Speaker 1  (03:33)
How do I think my bill? How do I keep my house recording, what do I do about that if they watch all ideas from more than 10 healthy design? But IM only time how to stay in life, it's not hard to somebody else where say my all you have to do, which is not quite give them any examples did not this mind. 

Speaker 1  (03:59)
You had to see all yep, there's nothing to do with you other than your residing English and this is the result complete of what you've done in themselves, but when you become too slight, it's not like you're saying, alcrystal, make it all good. You say location, please engage me in your service. Whatever my talent might be from my passport.

I can do I grow the serious when I suspection because it's a question if I want to take care of the of the island of the planet, do it for Christian, you don't have to not do it. It's just why you are doing you doing. 

Speaker 1  (04:54)
How already becomes a friend, but if you become famous and you don't give Krishna any good 

Speaker 2  (05:04)
Now I keep my discussion shot. I think I got most of the things, what does, or how does our Krishna tell us to take care of our mother, nature or biodiversity in forms of plants, animals, rivers? 

Speaker 1  (05:19)
Will you love my mother movie? I'm sure when we in internal. Yes, we're doing reconstruction, because we needed a much bigger home and residences for people come and visit, so we had a Bhumi Puja, yes, Put the corners down 

Speaker 1  (05:48)
about doing to bring more people rare sham, so we can do that, if if my job used to make years more foothill. She is now in an end, in-and-in such a wishing was standing on 4 legs now in gallery, which she is only standing on one leg the next truth for us. And if we don't tell the truth, if we don't tell a good, I'll worry like gives the truth you can hear. 

Speaker 1  (06:20)
It you can reject that eventually she falls down the car falls down if we lose the can. Look at you so much medicine so much Devi, so much love and n. Age Krishna is Krishna tense Khan, she's a cow, what is that said him? 

Speaker 1  (06:43)
So for me, anybody who's in regenerative agriculture will generally biodiver's, any any of the bio science necessary trying to keep the ears from falling apart. All I have to do is that one everything Krishna do and feel. 

Speaker 2  (07:00)
Now 

Speaker 1  (07:03)
Because then you can know that was fine, there were times when it was right off was like, sometimes I wasn't getting can I Put skipping messages? Then I wanna took my final check right before I got my license, the young man who is giving me a chat 1. You said, look, you're very, very good driver, go back or teach you more so to me that Mrs Krishna Singh. 

Speaker 1  (07:34)
Okay, you don't really good job. What you doing is extremely normal extreme because you are one of only a few, even although that know if we all held hands would be a lot of us, but you are 1 of you who sees the that's the purpose, it's just making sure that the purpose is tied to the reason behind the purpose 

Speaker 2  (08:04)
He has so as a closing remark like what kind of message would you like to give the global scientific community as well as the global youth from saratan Dharma? 

Speaker 1  (08:21)
Yes, you're very knowledgeable, but your science can only go so far when you look at the Vegas, she, the infinite wisdom and you see the climbing alive with the planets and all of our short dress and everything else and we know the things to be traced back exactly in time based on when things were happening the question you have asked yourself, can I create a song? The Chinese are now working on an artificial Sun. They're gotta last for 18 seconds, how long has a very days, how many billions of years and they are proud about 18 seconds? 

Speaker 1  (09:04)
Yeah, you know, or I can build a hypersonic vessel that can travel so fast. What do you think about like, you destroy the whole planet and almost dead? Because ashvitama, so I basically take the message to scientists, please understand no matter how much you know, you'll never know Krishna, if you're thinking you're the classroom, then I talk for some sign this, you say, if you just give us one little OK. 

Speaker 1  (09:39)
We know we can explain that, but just give us that then we can explain everything so yes, but one more thing you can explain is what is gone. Yes, and as far as love the youth, there is a very a very interesting situation. They have a change because of the increasing congestions around the world of how bad friends, are they have a chance that turns things around If they work together but the best way of and this is not to say you need to become. 

Speaker 1  (10:11)
I just can't hurry question, but if you can't just chap in this matter, check the request number and do your work together work with each other, you can change the face of ear words it down. You said that my movement will persist on this final chatting or a Krishna. In every kind of village for 10000 years, I was only 500 years ago so that gives us time we have a lot of time to make things better. 

Speaker 1  (10:41)
We can, if we, if we're careful, we can keep it from falling apart. So bad that we learn the hard work, so the society describes itself out of greed and lust than anger and jealousy in envy. Or we can decide, OK, let's go awesome once together and you know who can destroy everything around this meaning of all about ancestors for generations. 

Speaker 2  (11:22)
I really like to follow Bhagavati and I think I have only read a Prabhu Palak ji translation. 

Speaker 1  (11:32)
Yes, this is wonderful because there are so many translations of the leader with so many translators missed the park where my Christmas says I am the supreme. Then they wash over like all I read and me now he just mean so I'm lying, I'm drama and you become like me, then you can. Become romance like you'll never be Christian. 

Speaker 1  (11:53)

Speaker 2  (12:29)
Open second I just 

Speaker 1  (12:30)
Is GAR UN Tarun tarun ki Gandhi? My Girl told me music Krishna is eternally fresh. He's always expanding is always new and he's always useful, and so all my life I Ve been younger than everybody, even though I'm I have lots of energy, she does not you just told me remember that Krishna is always blue. 

Speaker 1  (12:57)
It's not always know, so for me, the big question, which is only fashionable, he's unchanging. He is all of this, but he's always experiments, always look what an amazing being and his name Krishnan for me, that's that's really wonderful. 

Speaker 2  (13:32)
Yes. 

Speaker 1  (13:33)
So that's it. I mean, you're another proper. You said all the time, not asking people to start being Christian or start being introducing Hindu and Husband just add the changing of this carpool, because it's been given to us, by what's your question, as our means were in this yoga of salvation? 

Speaker 1  (13:53)
Yes, before you know. It's too caring. How long can we go without looking at our phone no? 

Speaker 1  (14:09)

Speaker 1  (14:23)
So we were almost, we were going to go today at the time that happy 

Speaker 2  (14:31)

Speaker 1  (02:05)
Choice, like it's like 

Speaker 2  (02:28)
I think means I almost got like questions to many answers like I was looking for but yes, I would want to make it more formal so like first of all, I think we are already. 

Speaker 1  (02:38)
Recording, are you recording? 

Speaker 2  (02:41)
Yes, I would want to 

Speaker 1  (02:42)
Bixby how was your weather reported very sad already? 

Speaker 2  (02:47)
That is to so, actually, that is what I thought there is some hassle and vasal, so means if we could sit somewhere, so yeah, so first thing which I really think is one of the questions is when we talk about its spirituality or religiosity and when we talk about the worldly. Affairs, such as climate change or any 

Speaker 1  (03:07)
How can you? He is very brain of the young. 

Speaker 2  (03:12)
Absolutely. I think yeah, so means should we really relate the worldly affairs, the consumerism or our day to day habits and activities to the spirituality or the fullness of of our Sanatan Dharma? 

Speaker 1  (03:28)
How can you, how can we separate it is our nature? We are not too entirely. The man who says, I'm gone, you say I want with everything on Bixby card, the other story was the story about the the the man who was told by his guru that yoga, and that is walking down Sri Ganga fever in a village you sing, oh, run run, there's a mad elephant, he's coming. 

Speaker 1  (03:56)
This way is coming this way and the man's last story. And God, I'm gone. And he gets trapped by the elephant and he's laying on the road is all beat up and people coming by what happen. 

Speaker 1  (04:06)
What happened, I don't know, oh my God, I don't know what happened. There is good comes mine, it's go chirchi, what happened and God he see, yes, but the elephant was a good 

Speaker 2  (04:14)
Every girl 

Speaker 1  (04:18)
So we have, we still have this on. We say that religion means to practice a certain thing. What a believer, certain thing or don't do a certain thing, but ray legio, that's the land religious legio, means to link, go to try and rain means to recall, so it's the relinky to that. 

Speaker 1  (04:49)
And that's why religion misses the way because they are not trying. In many cases, they're not understanding their true relationship because of they did everybody. They saw would be their Brother since issues because of an answer. 

Speaker 1  (05:09)
So unfortunately makes religion become more about where is the birth distribution? Once yesterday was here, would I travel around?

Speaker 1  (02:31)
ऐसा है? देखें विज्ञान का युग चल रहा है? हमारे पास लोग क्यों आते हैं सूर्य को क्यों महत्व दे रहे चंद्रमा को महत्व क्यों दे रहे जल को इतना महत्व क्यों है वायु को इतना महत्व क्यों है आप देखिए कहीं न कहीं यदि सूर्य का महत्व नहीं रहेगा वैज्ञान क्यों सूर्य को मान रहा है आप देखिए ज्वाला जी हमारे भारत देश में ज्वाला देवी मंदिर है रामेश्वर है गंगा है। अनेकों प्रकार के प्रत्यक्ष हमारे देवी देवताओं के महत्व रखना चाहता है तो देवताओं के आशीर्वाद से ही बनेगा जब तक चंद्रमा भगवान परमिशन नहीं देंगे। आप कैसे होगा? 

Speaker 1  (03:15)
पहुंच जाएंगे? आप कैसे वह घर बना लेंगे? तो हमारे यहां क्या है कि देवी-देवताओं को ही महत्व दिए जाते हैं प्रत्येक कार्य को भगवान को ही माना जाता है और हमारे यहाँ महत्व है भगवान का ही हम लोग तो क्या है कर मात्र के व्यक्ति हैं।

Speaker 1  (04:16)
यदि हमारा धर्म रहेगा आप देखिए जिन लोगों ने धर्म को महत्व दिया उनके बहुत सारे देश हैं तो कहीं न कहीं हमें धर्म को महत्व देना चाहिए।

Speaker 1  (16:47)
ऋषि ने जिस समय में तब क्या होगा योग क्या होगा? उस समय भी स्थाई मशीन का आविष्कार हुआ होगा। हुआ होता तो वे ट्रैक सूट के अंदर योग कर रहे हो मुझे निलंबित किया गया 2016 केंद्र बनाते थी। 10वीं दिन निलंबित किया कि मैं सीने में कपड़े पहनकर छोटे-छोटे बच्चों को लेकर के शॉपिंग मोल लिया। उस काल के अंदर हाट बाज़ार हुआ करते थे आश्रम के लिए रसद पानी खरीदने के लिए ऋषिमुनि भी जाते आज क्या हाट बाज़ार शॉपिंग मॉल है? यदि मैं वहां जा रहा हूं तो क्या पाप कर रहा हूं? 

Speaker 1  (17:27)
मुझे 4 वेद 18 पुराण 108 उपनिषद स्मृतियां छोड़ दीजिए बाइबल ग्राम दुरात एंजिल इनके बारे में बात करते और वे जवाब नहीं दे पाता तब उसे निलंबित करते हैं। क्या बड़े हैं बड़े लोगों ने गरीब आपने मुझे निलंबित कर दिया। अब बात कर लीजिए उन्होंने शिकारा और फिर से मुझे माफ होने से उसी दिवस द्वित्तीय जिसकी उत्पत्ति में था। हमें कुछ नहीं करना है हमारे भारतीय विरासत का समर्थन करना तो अनेकानेक ग्रंथ जिनको हमें लॉजिकल लोग आप जैसे पहुंचे उनको बोलने किसका अब सहयोग जी निकालें। दक्षिण कोरिया के दक्षिण कोरिया जाकर के मुझसे बोला गया जब हिन्दू मेहनत नहीं या बाइबल पढ़े? 

Speaker 1  (18:35)
वे बाइबल पढ़ने को तैयार में भेरेंगे न मुझे कुरान पढ़ाई मैं कुरान पढ़ने होते हैं। ये साधन हिंदुओं वो सबको शिकार करता है और जब दक्षिण कोरिया ने मुझे बाइबल प्ले। उन्होंने उनके 7 लैब स्टैंड्स की व्याख्या करी जब मुझे अवसर दिया गया 148 देशों के साथ उन्होंने बताया कि आप जिनको प्रतीकात्मक रूप से 7 लैब डिस्टेंस बोल रहे। उम्र सप्तर्षि हैं रीके की व्याख्या खरीद बाइबल से संयुक्त रखती थी सहमत घाताले बजाकर के अनुमोदन किया भाई बहन क्या दुबई गया? वहां पर मैंने बोला कि नवोज़मों में लाइव इंजाली तुम्हें तेरे शिवा कोई और नहीं वो मेरे विक्वेद से निकला हुआ है एम? 

Speaker 1  (19:25)
ए कॉस वहीं रसिक धर्म के तक ही कुंभकार सतना लेकिन कार्य वही। मेरा अन्य धर्म ग्रंथ के दीप साधु को देखें साहिब और ऐसा क्यों सबका मालिक एक है? शंकराचार्य के अद्वैत प्रतिपादन के लायक है अद्वैत कोई ही नहीं वही की रुचिकर उस न्यू बाइबल के अंदर साउथ गुरिया ने लिखा संस्कृत। इस द मदर ऑफ़ ऑल लैंग्वेज इन सनातन हिंदू रिलिजन इस द सोर्स और साथी हिंदू धर्म रिलीज़। उन्होंने उनको फिर बताया कि रिलीज और धर्मा में अंतर क्या रिलिजन का मतलब है री कनेक्टिंग बुधवार ऑल द भ्रामिक रिलिजन सेज गॉड इस लेफ्ट फोटो को स्विडिट करें दूरी कनेक्ट की थीम वैली 2 परफॉर्म स्टेन डेट्स थॉट रिचुअल्स एट्टेट महेश। रात इंदू धर्मा शेष गॉड स्थिति न्यू आपके दर्जेश्वर को नरेंद्र के शोर का। सभी फिल्म गॉड इस प्रेजेंट एवरीवन इस ओमनी प्रेजेंट रिलिजन सा डिवाइड फ्रॉम धर्म। हेनरी सनातन धर्म उसका लॉजिक अंक का जवाब भी था वो मुझे हर साल बुलाते। मुझे अच्छी बातें सुनने के लिए बुलाते गुजार। तो बात करके समझिए भारतीय स्नातक हिंदू धर्म किसी भी नियम से नफरत ही नहीं करता है एक मात्र धर्म में हिन्दू धर्म जिसने धर्म के आधार पर विश्व के किसी भी राष्ट्र पर 

Speaker 1  (21:28)
आक्रमण नहीं किया। किसी के भी भू भाग पर कब्जा नहीं किया एकबार घर में हिंदू धर्म जिसने कभी धर्म परिवर्तन के लिए किसी को भी प्रेशर नहीं किया उसके बाद में हम पे उंगली उठाएगा। पूरा विषय तमिल इन बातों को भूल तो घर से। 

Speaker 2  (21:58)
अभी एक रिसर्च पेपर आया था महाराज काफी रिलायंस साइंटिस्ट का था। उनका फाइंडिंग है कि गंगा माता इस बायोलॉजिकल लिमिट अर्थात इसमें जो ऑक्सीजन कंटेंट होता है उसमें फिकल कंटेंट कंपनी केमिकल्स जो एफिसिस किया उनके आधार पर जो उनके भी पैरामीटर्स जैसे हमारा ब्लड टेस्ट होता है उन्होंने गंगा मादा। का टेस्ट किया। उन्होंने अपना पेपर लेकिन आज हम महाकुंभ के परिपेक्ष में बैठे हैं और 400000000 लोग यहां तक पहुंचेंगे पहुंच रहे हताहत की खबर के बाद भी लोगों का रूझान कम नहीं हुआ है उतना ही है। क्या चीज़ है जो हमें गंगा मादक खींच खिलाती है? 

Speaker 2  (22:46)
क्या वो डर है? स्पेरिच्योरिटी का या देखम देखी है या टूरिज्म में क्या चीजें। 

Speaker 1  (22:51)
देखिए सबसे पहले सबसे लास्ट वाला पॉइंट ऑफ़ टूरिज़न इस पर बोलूंगा हमारी जितनी यात्राएं होती है वह 3 प्रकार के विभागों में भक्त एक होता है दिशा गुस्सा होता है तीर्थाटन तो तीसरा होता है पर्यटक गंगा का युद्धक है प्रयाग सर्वप्रथम तीर्थाटन कास्य यह तीर्थ बनाएं। इतिर्थाटन का क्षेत्र संगम में उद्घाटन का क्षेत्र दूसरा। अतः देश प्रयाग और काशी संबद्ध। यहां पे शास्त्रार्थ की परंपराएं रही आदि गुरु शंकराचार्य के समय से जो हमारे एजुकेशन एक्जेशन से थिंक्स कर सकते हैं उसको कहते हैं बेशक जिस पर शंकराचार्य का पूरा जीवन निकला 32 होता वहां से जो। उच्चतम साहित्य निकला वनस्पति निकली औषध दी निकली जीवनशैली निकली उसका उन्हें अध्ययन करा और प्रचार करा। ये निचोड़ता है कि योगी या पर्यटन का क्षेत्र बिल्कुल भी। पर्यटन केंद्र मनोरंजन उसे मन से जुड़ा हुआ ये पर्यटन के क्षेत्र नहीं है। इसमें शासन जब कितना धार्मिक पर्यटन अधूरे ज्ञान का परिचायक एवं पर्यटन शब्द कीर्थाटन और देशाटन के क्षेत्र लगे पर्यटन क्यों गोवा पर्यटन का क्षेत्र जबकि वो भी तीर्थाटन का क्षेत्र था परशुराम और दुर्वासा को भंडारक के रूप में। उन्होंने उस क्षेत्र की 

Speaker 1  (24:47)
स्थापना की थी बुआ पशु के फंसे से स्थापित है। वहां पर यहां धर्म अध्यात्म इसकी नजरें पुर्तगालियों के बाद में उसको खंडित किया गया किंतु बाद के शासकों ने क्या करो आज के शासकों ने भी क्या किया पर जनता क्षेत्र बना दिया तो पर्यटन का क्षेत्र वो क्षेत्र होता है जहां पे मन को अलग सा आनंद मिले मनोरंजन की जमीन। वो भाई अभिव्यक्ति और आंतरिक अभिव्यक्ति के रूप में देश ऑटोमेटिक घाटा में नंबर दूसरा अपने सवाल करा। 

Speaker 2  (25:26)
गंगा जीके दिन रहना चाहिए। 

Speaker 1  (25:28)
पति के बाल टिकट गंगा का कहना कै। बैक्टीरिया फिजिस बैक्टीरिया टीम बैक्टीरें बैक्टर वेजेस का जो दौर आया उसे गंगा के अंदर राम तेरी गंगा बेली कहा क्यों कहा गया। इसके तहत डिजिटल गेस्ट आने लगा इसके अंदर कहने की पोजीशन आ रहा है किंतु भूल की गंगा यमुना के। बाद में एक नृत्य नदी है सरस्वती। आपने कभी धंधा तट के एपेलेबिक देखना क्या गंगा तट पर कभी मॉब स्टेरिया देखा? क्या 1954 में देखा और अभी थोड़ा सा देगी एक कोने के अंदर देखा। वो भी गंगा के तट पर नहीं देते बाहर गंगा का जो इलेक्ट्रोमैक्वेटिक फील्ड है संगम का उतना ऊंचाई कि विज्ञान तो बच्चे का भी बच्चे का बच्चा यह समझ नहीं पाएगा। 144 साल का एक कुंभ है महाकुंभ जिसको कहते 12 साल देवताओं का मनुष्य का और एक दिन देवताओं का दोबारा दिन देवताओं का है। इन 12 दिन जो है ना इनके अंदर जितने भी अस्तित्व हैं चाहे वह पितृ लोक क्यों जैव देव लोग क्यों जितने भी लोग लोग हैं क्यों? 

Speaker 1  (26:55)
जितनी छोड़ोयी न हो मातृका हूं। जितने अंतरिक्ष के अंदर जितने ग्रह हैं उन सबका जो अस्तित्व है जीवन निर्जीवन का स्तंभ ने उन्हें का स्पंद है वो सब यहां पर तो आप इसको कैसे भुला सकते? इसके अंदर अचानक कुछ होता है। यह मान करके चलिए की प्रकृति बहुत कुछ इशारे करते हैं प्रकृति धर्म को अवसर दिया। इस घटना का महत्व शिव के मानस से बेची हुई निगाएँ। फाइनेंस को आंतरिक अभिव्यक्ति में देखें तो हमारे पैनल से निकलने वाले सारे एंजाइम सो को स्पीकर लेना अपने अपने स्वयं का अभिषेक कर रहे हैं। शिव के शीर्ष से निकली गंगा उसे सबसे बड़ा शिव कोई तो मिलाया तभी तो पूरे विश्व का वो ध्यान कर पा रहे हैं। उसके बाद में विश्व को नहीं लाए गंगा का आध्यात्मिक सांकेति वैज्ञानिक महत्व बेहद ज्यादा है। 

Speaker 2  (28:08)
हमारा सनातन धर्म जैविविधता संरक्षण के लिए किस प्रकार से मैसेज देता है या क्या करना चाहिए आज के परिपेक्ष हैं? 

Speaker 1  (28:17)
देखिए इसके लिए आपको सबसी बातें तुलसीदास जीके कथा में जो उन्होंने राम को लिखा उसको समझ लीजिए जो चौंक आए हैं दो पाए हैं रेंगने वाले हैं इन सबको हम शिव पुराण से लेकर के रावण तक किया है हमारा स्नातक व प्रत्येक साहित्य जैव विविधता को संरक्षण करने की बात कहूं क्योंकि प्रगति के। संतुलन के लिए इन सबका होना आवश्यक है। यदि नहीं होता तो सुदर्शन को घिस करके फेंका नहीं जाता। यदि नहीं होता तो जामवंत नहीं होते सुग्रीव नहीं होता बाली नहीं होता ग्रहीवता बालोनीलगिनी सांकेतिक अभिव्यक्तियां हैं। इसके अंदर प्रत्येक जीवन को सूक्ष्मता से लेकर के दिव्याख्या मत्स्य प्रणाम की तरह बड़ी मछली है भेल से क्या काम करें? 

Speaker 1  (29:19)
सबको लेकर गई मुरु को लेकर की गई और नए निर्माण का कारक बनीं नहीं बचाती मनु को उनके शिष्यों क्या नया सृजन होता जैव विविधता नव सृजन का कारक है और उनका संरक्षण हमारा परम कर्तव्य है। आप 4 रेड 18 पुराण रूम का जितने धर्म ग्रंथ है विश्व के पढ़ लीजिए उनमें अधिकार शब्द। की व्याख्याएं। उनमें से उसे कर्तव्य शब्द ज्यों विविधताओं का संवर्धन संरक्षण हमारा कर्तव्य है। 

Speaker 2  (29:56)
तुम्हारा जी हमारा कर्तव्य है तो पिछले 102 साल में खासकर के ये वीकली समितियाँ आई हैं हमारे धर्म गुरु या जो हमारा अध्यात्म है कर्मकांड है ये तो लगातार बड़े-बढ़ने बढ़ोतरी की ओर है। तो ये होने के बाद भी जो हमारा भारतीय है जो सनातनी मानता है अपने आपको। वो ये चीज़ क्यों नहीं कर पा रहा है या। 

Speaker 1  (30:23)
से वावरण की बढ़ोतरी हरि के चौराहे पर आप देखेंगे भागवत हर गली के अंदर निकलेंगे और ज्योतिषाचारी यह आवरण का वृद्धि है। क्या क्षण की वृद्धि नहीं है? आचरण की वृद्धि अधि करनी है उनको तपस्या करना होगा। 

Speaker 3  (30:40)
अकेले शिवा ने। 

Speaker 1  (30:43)
अधिक कर रहे होते सड़कों पर नहीं घूमती विकेताओं के प्रवचन में गायमारी माताएं सड़क पर छोड़कर आता है। दिमाग को सड़क में छोड़ने वाला यह धर्म के जो तथाकथित ठेकेदार मुख्य मुंह पर तो जूते मार रहे थे आप देखेंगे गोमांस का निर्यात आयात कहां से कितना क्या हो रहा है जो गले में भगवान लाल के घोर संबंधन की बात कर रहे हैं ना उनके चरित्र सामने आ जाएंगे। अनेकानेक चरित्र हैं हम बात करते हैं साथ देखेंगे जब योग और रिएक्टिव की बात करूं। आयुष मंत्रालय केंद्र सरकार बड़ा कार्यक्रम हमारे चरित्र में भी होगा तो उसका लाभ कैसे उठा लो? 

Speaker 1  (31:39)
यकीन की हम बात करें यज्ञ के अंदर आहुतियों की सामग्री यदि अपवित्र होंगी वनों के अंदर यदि अगर गरीब उच्चतम नहीं मिलेगा। तो, क्या कार्बन मोनोऑक्साइड के अंदर फ्यूजन ओवर नाइट्रोजन का या अन्य देशों का नहीं होता है? यज्ञ का प्रमाण भी नहीं मिल पा रहा है ढंग से क्योंकि सामग्री शुद्ध नहीं है हमें खुद को देखना होगा इसको वास्तविक मापदंडों में मानदंडों में हमें पालन करना रोमिनी कृपा दिया आधुनिक काल खली हुए और। कलिकाल के जरिए माल करके चलिए। जिसने मान लिया क्या शत्रु है वह 10 लोगों को लेकर के बढ़िया उसके दसों के जीवन ज्यादा सती ही चलेगा। विज्ञान भी कहते हैं ब्रह्म के माल के चलिए प्रसाद घटिया खलु के कलियुगे जो गलत करो गलत ही मिल रहा है जो सही कर रहा है उसको सीखा पड़ा था लेट मिल रहा। है क्योंकि गलत ज्यादा है। किंतु जो और जगह कर देगा 4 गुना कर देगा प्रमाण मिल रहा है परिणाम मिल रहा है तो तपस्या का युग है शुद्ध और आनंद से जीना चाहिए और ज्यादा चरित्र के साथ जीना चाहिए। जिला क्षेत्र हिसाब सोचोगे वैसा योग होता है आपके मन में अब सचिव भी आई है सचिव का जाए तो इस प्रयास में कि सबको आनंद मिले हैं ताकि सती उगाजी। 

Speaker 1  (33:26)
हमारे आस-पास के लोगों की झूठ क्यों घटनाओं के हिसाब हो गया? उसे इसको धोखा देकर आनंद लेते हैं उनकी बुद्वीति विकसित हो गई स्तो गुड़ी होने के कारण तो कोई बात नहीं होने दीजिए जो महाकाल का भक्त है उसी ने कार की ये भूत वर्तमान भविष्य जो एक कार है जो महाकाल इन दिनों। से ऊपर है। महाकाल का जो वक्त करेगा वो किसी प्रकार के युग की अवधारणाओं के ऊपर कन्फ्यूज नहीं होगा रिज़न में नहीं आया। 

Speaker 2  (34:11)
इसका क्लोज़िंग स्टेटमेंट आप से चाहूँगा कि ग्लोबल साइंटिफिक कम्युनिटी और ग्लोबल यूथ कोड आप क्या मैसेज देना चाहते हैं और उनको क्या करना चाहिए? 

Speaker 1  (34:21)
मैं आमंत्रित करता हूँ। आप पाइए मेरे पास मैं आपको बिना मोबाइल के संदेश भेजने की प्रक्रिया सिखाता हो। आप आइए मेरे पास मैं बिना भाई अस्तित्व के बिना आर्टिफिक्स आर्टिफिशियल इंटीरियल मैं इमोशनल इंटेलिएंस सिखाता हूँ लोग बोलते हैं चुप के जरिए भावुक होना मूर्खता है। मैं कहता हूं कि आप बहुत नहीं तो मानव नहीं। और मानव होने का वास्तविक मायना मैं आपको सिखाता हूं ग्लोबल साइंटिफिक कमिटी को समझना होगा कि उनके हाइड्रोजन जहां पर वो फाइट। वहां के बाहर हमने नटराज की प्रतिमा को लगवाई थी समझिए विश्व ने उसको क्यों स्वीकारा है? 

Speaker 1  (35:12)
आप ये समझिए क्या आपका हिटेन भी जो है सूक्षोत्तम अवस्था के ऊपर प्राप्त कर रहा है तो सूक्ष्मत्त अवस्था जो है हमारी ऋग्वैदिक क्यों है। आप हमारे साहित्य क्यों? राहिए, क्या आपको घर लौटना ही होगा दया से ज्ञान का हुआ है? आपको यह देखना होगा क्या आपका शारीरिक विज्ञान है? 

Speaker 1  (35:35)
वो शरीर नहीं है मनी भी है मनी नहीं है। बुद्धि दी है और बुद्धि नहीं है महात्मा भी और आत्मा ही नहीं है ऊपर महात्मा की ओर इन चतुष्टयों से प्रदीप न है तो विज्ञान को मानना पड़ेगा भारतीय वैदिक स्नातक अध्यात्म जो है। इसे हजारों विज्ञानों का पर पिता वहां हैं हम साबित करके दिखाएंगे आपको ऐसा भी विषय वस्तु लाइए हम उसको अनुसंधान करेंगे और यह कोई युद्ध का विषय नहीं है। ये विज्ञान भी उसी अध्यात्म का रूचर है। छात्र में बैठकर के निकाल देना मैं युग की संकल्पना करते तभी तो नवीन युग का प्रारंभ होगा। इसके अंदर कोई दुखी नहीं होगा। प्रत्येक को सुख धारणा देंगे। ये मेरा सपने। 

Speaker 2  (36:24)
इसको रिकार्डिंग को तो मैं बंद कर देता हूँ क्यूंकि जो ऑफिशल ही मेरे को लेना तब वह मैंने ले लिया।

We have to find ways how to make people understand that this is good for them. Plan. Do you say that if you fail to plan, then you plan to fail? So you have to study planning now, you, go on pen and paper. Go on plan in your mind because there'll be so many cross thoughts and conflicting thoughts, there'll be utter confusion on you.

You will not find a way out to put all your thoughts on pen and paper in your diary. All problems. Ten, fifty, hundred, five hundred thousand. You take a problem on a separate page. Think about it.

What to do? Then you have a road map to how you should go about your problem. He says plan your work and then work your plan. So he had many such things to say, which in his own time were very futuristic. And, So they have to also get children at a very young age and make them understand by many ways how to conserve ecology, what are benefits, what are gains.

So they will be understanding with I'm trying, and I'm trying to see the day of the light. I'm not sure right now. My good wishes, pleasure, and blessings only. God and, great ones give. So blessings always there.

The sun is always shining. Shining, regardless. It's not holding back anything. So Guruji someone asked Guruji, asked him to bless him. Guruji says, you have my blessings.

You need yours. So it means that you need to make an effort to get to connect with divine. That is the message we need to do for us ourselves. Everything is there, but we have to make clear. Yes, sir.

If yeah. Please. There's a law that operates. There's a law that operates. That law is will.

And those who have not given when it's been asked of them, they'll do much, but they will get relief from nothing at all. And school is supposing you have a savings account and you keep withdrawing from it without defaulting, the bank management will die. So this is how karma account works. If I want to be in the first category and I want to have a sizable neck account, I have to keep giving without asking. If not in the in the entirety, there's some portion of our income.

That's why in our Hindu families used to have feed the cows first, give the dog something, feed the birds, give some ants something. So that way, we were doing good charitable activities regularly. Once you start giving, it is in giving that you receive. The mystery of life is in giving that you receive. When we start expecting, then you'll not get anything.

You become selfish. If you want to withdraw from the bank, but without without deposit, today we are keeping what we have shown in the past. Tomorrow we'll reap unless we serve today. So Guruji says everything in the future will improve if you are making a special effort now. So now what we are doing depends on what we are going to get in the future.

So now is very important. Today, you have everything in your hand. Tomorrow, you will take it. Right? Thank I was not saying man's eternal quest.

Man's eternal quest. That's the book which transformed me or gave me the insight into life, gave me the clarity of the jigsaw puzzle of life. So so that mind is much clearer, understands, how things operate online. So that is a wonderful book to read."

Speaker 1  (00:01)
You can pay and bring it back, but this mosquito cannot doing that so I was ready to avoid killing it for another month or so again, I cycling the third time helped the Boy said no, if you can repay a penalty condition, you pay ₹5000 to the ashram for killings economy, but that became a deterrent 5000 for a mosquito. Why would we want to give that kind of money? So, but then if I do give 5000I gain some good karma. 

Speaker 1  (00:38)
So it will doubly sorry it become a deterrent, but also in 1 day it will benefit the action, but then it, of course was served as more as a deterrent than getting good health so that was able to help me in stopping me from killing doors. So we should understand that God is gone to great deed. Effort in making everything Even a grain of wheat or any flower or any flower is the you try making a statue right, you will understand how difficult it is and to make a statue which can walk talk the right? 

Speaker 1  (01:29)
Speak, sleep, warp have desires in temptation. Can you kind of Americans, what kind of complex enjoying would have gone and to make a mosquito. So cheer, so everything God is going into so much detail in making and we must start appreciating, somebody says there's an Art of Living life, there are 2 ways to see see a flower one is to see an analyse or what kind of red colour in this flower has what kind of fragals, it has what a kind green leaves it has. 

Speaker 1  (02:08)
This is one approach, the analytical, there are other approaches. Be appreciate a way, enjoying it. What lovely red colour it has word beautiful frighteners, but lovely you can please it, yes, what is the better effort? 

Speaker 2  (02:24)
Close the second message. 

Speaker 1  (02:25)
When we start enjoying an tasting away, the first is dry, absolutely analytical, you don't get anything out of it. Just analysing analyzing and lying, that's it. The second one ISIS tasting the honey, the nectar or things so only a true can tell us the Art of Living, what is the right way to live? 

Speaker 1  (02:51)
So in the in the world began wisdom 3 levels. When is one own expenses? There's the longest and the hardest way to get towards down. 

Speaker 1  (03:02)
The second one is you learn through other these mistakes, someone has done the mistake he is suffering she is suffering. I should avoid me that suffering by not doing that seriously. The third is news wages, this is the shortest way to destination is like a Google Map, or what do you say? 

Speaker 1  (03:26)
Navigator you will have something so you Put your location and destination. You are there to the shortest, so it's like if I were to ask you to make a laptop, you may spend your entire lifetime will not be Jim, but if you get a book, just 2 cars to it components, send assembling, do it yourself. You buy the component symbol astro, do I am able to make it within a month or a year or so this is goes with this. 

Speaker 1  (03:55)
This tells you what is the purpose of life and how to attain it and he helps you along the waves. So now if you have any other further 

Speaker 2  (04:06)
Yes, I will try to keep it short. This question is a very recently, a scientific research paper came by one, some renowned scientists claiming that Ganga river is biologically dead due to the presence of less oxygen content, high flu and content, high fical content and so on and people, the strength towards spirituality of people. Towards that is ever-increasing, so how do you see or how should we see the 2 conflicts? 

Speaker 2  (04:37)
Parts of it. 

Speaker 1  (04:39)
See, the scientist and knowledge is in the stage of infancy. How to Put it 

Speaker 2  (04:59)
They are looking on the several points. 

Speaker 1  (05:01)
We cannot say that they know everything. For science goes down to the building block of the universe, to Put on neutron electron and then gets lost beyond that, there is a certain energy. What is that energy, which governs it, besides, where to make this into a flower and this to an animal, the building of the buck of universe? 

Speaker 1  (05:25)
What is the governing principle that they have no idea, but a Yogi realises enters, God has created the situation. And everything is being controlled by the poisonous, absolute right, so 100 years before science was knowing something right after 100 years from that time science knows more but 100 years from now let you know more what we know today will seem obsolete. Then what a knew 100 years ago before seeming off sleep from now. 

Speaker 1  (06:10)
Although I remember 91 used to use a floppy, which is that big. Yes, today, we have a microchip that big, which has one TV. Yes, we can understand what advancement it to policies happen is so many epsilot, so similarly, in 100 years to know, the technology will be far more investor so that we do not know what we have to know and videos from now, so can we know that say that science or everything for some? 

Speaker 1  (06:39)
Does it know the causes happen? So we know only very little about the physical reason Be very little know about the astral world, the only 2 things we know about the facul's electricity and magnetism, yet we do not know the nature beyond that, is the causal growth and beyond that is the causeless absolute discourage. There is nothing in this physical world that can reach that level. 

Speaker 1  (07:05)
And identify with God that this is the creator we cannot make unease, so science can never reach that level. The only thing that can reach that level is arm. Super conscious mind, guri says the wave cannot measure the ocean, but there's a point of contact between the ocean and the way that point of contact have this human with their super consciousness, this supervacious mind where the mind impinges the internet. 

Speaker 1  (07:33)
So though the scientists may say that Ganda is dead. But his knowledge is very finite, he hardly knows what life is all about. We cannot base our understanding what life a with see another way to Put it a sign. 

Speaker 1  (07:59)
The the knowledge gain from the census is fallible, not lovely. Why so because eyes can see only a Sun range of colour while it into a blue, green, yellow or grey, they cannot see alcoholic and flora colours so I'm not seeing the complete picture from the year school. You can hear Only sounds from 50 year for 20000 we cannot hear Microwave sounds of a dark songs or ultrasounds, so we cannot hear the hurt. 

Speaker 1  (08:31)
So what we seeing or hearing, or all that is only limited up the to know the complete, we have to have another faculty of line beaches, the intuition, which manifes in the mental calmers when the mind is calm, then that in. Total effective benefits, it is from that Difficulty we go out. This is only manufactured by God, no human instrument can measure, because it's it's it is made of physical thing. 

Speaker 1  (09:07)
We cannot case the suckler as side can never learn and we cannot base our wisdom on scientists who have very little difficult, so let them say today, scientists say this thing, then they contradict themselves 10 year later or someone must say key mother's breastfeeding is good, someone would say no, we have banned faciable mother, though the Credit, keep or nervous statements so how can we base on our life on them so much? Why do we have so many cities around the bank again if it were dead? How do we have so much irrigation happening from the river, how many grains is being grown by irrigation repeat birthday baby cannot base are decisions on scientists have very limited amicables. 

Speaker 2  (10:17)
Somebody would like to give a message to the global community global youth on biodiversity conservation and have our preservations how should they look at to the problem and how can they try to find a solution to 

Speaker 1  (10:36)
See, there is an epics a perimetical structure. We have hugry birds more than carnivals. That is how the structure in the world is created so the number of human beings may so many so much oxygen so many trees. 

Speaker 1  (11:00)
So unless the technological balance is maintained. Uh, human life is in grave risky, so yet there will be people in the society, there will be many countries in the society who some of them are ahead of The Times some are living with times some are behind things, the vast majority is behind times you are big times and far fewer or behind ahead of times so the responsibility of keeping. Ecological balance is more on the middle in the upper level. 

Speaker 1  (11:41)
Those who are living with times are those who are living ahead of names. These are people who are motivated and can give some time out of their life to or the general cause, because they have risen beyond their personal needs and desires the ground level The base is meeting the challenge of Having 2 square meals a day, we do not expect them to there was these response. They will be only they can be instructed to do things, but we cannot expect them to think beyond themselves so We have heard many stories like people planting trees on their mother's death. 

Speaker 1  (12:34)
Our Father's death or so many plants every year, like in muzakhandvi, I have a functional or a celebration called harila, where it is held in monsoons, where every one consort intentions, so this is very interesting because that society is a society which is little intuiad and still repairs of the cultural heritage of India, much of the causal heritage were distorted by the advent to mughals in British, so did I mention the 4 classifications of human life, the branches? See, today's education is more on how to earn not how to level so first half we are losing our health to gain well second half. 

Speaker 1  (13:29)
We are losing our wealth together. So from health can get well, but from wealth, you cannot give back so we have a limited time frame, so police says gods laws are very illegal zone, but there's no network there. So gravitation law is universal, be it man or over or young or old, or which are poor it is same for them to surprise them has to burn whether a 60-year-old man puts his hand to it out of 6 months. 

Speaker 1  (13:55)
Aid puts the Child has not known that the fire does not know that the Child should be squared. It does not move so, if a murderer birth to the coincdeshing lot peaceful me, I did not know by committing this how to set us for life again capital punishment, which does not explain, but it needs ignorance of noise. No, excuse means you better know the moment, would you say if you behave like an idiot to deserve to suffer. 

Speaker 1  (14:20)
So if I have certain wisdom like gone, govern my life, then I will link range from the rent, so there are certain rules that apply just certain doors and loans. So and then the main honest to live in the world, but we not saints who have attend themselves in God, have in A They pounded on a Nancy at these rules for Mankind, but having given us a fever, God is not going to force her pull with us. You live it this way, you are assured of a better life. 

Speaker 1  (14:53)
A happy life is like someone I read or heard that you go to the market to buy an electronic equipment get a manual with it, you say it's writing I can use it the way out to yeah, 6 year you can do it up for it in the dustbin. Who case who is going to ask you a question. But if you want to give a good service, go as per restriction venue, then we made it may. 

Speaker 1  (15:16)
If I live there similarly, there is an assessment for life, so if you go by that you will have a content and happy life, it's old, then be assured that you not have a happy so what are the rules that apply certain do in certain doors may escalate in the world be Lord of it. The aggreie says supposing you have the minest milk in the world in their quarter. If you mix the 2, they become one, then cannot separate milk from water, you take look at a lit with a third in it. 

Speaker 1  (15:46)
Time this milk becomes good. You check this equipment lessy butter you Put in water. It floats, so in the gurukul time, the very time the childhood brought to the gurukul with his Wife school, the guru had a few section in this mind in the form of girl and asked me to meditate when the mind would become third then, who started journey dismal train when though. 

Speaker 1  (16:07)
Mayor turn to butter than the group would say. Yes, now are you're ready for home work? So he come to the world's water with his Wife's milk, my is butter, basically Harry, does everything as you Housing them would do, but with a difference that this wild children given to me, do not love they belong to God god girls in them, so whatever he does becomes a version, a house becomes a human. 

Speaker 1  (16:30)
He also has a very fine dismination between modern need and water desired. She fulfils the needs of the film does not spoil them by fulfilm her desire half he's got the married as edian man, his job responding towards her miss, so he comes into a buffer zone, which is between Western cinels, which is called workers where he dedicates himself to seeking God and sevas. He dies, which he might able despite being a better After receiving styles, he moved to the last this seminarka. 

Speaker 1  (16:57)
Here he dedicates himself entirely to sing God. There was the last person he has to know, so these were 4 categories of a human life which have a certain role in different terms. Today, that first in the formal part is absent where you get formal failure and how to get that. 

Speaker 1  (17:12)
Now, what happens, we come into the world water with our mind's milk, the 2 become 1, then what happens, you have high potential blood pressure is suicide Democrats model of God knows what's happened because you're not living in the mountain as well as I said, we will be confided with. Many situations that broadly can characterise and favourable and favour the issue is not with capable, which is unfair, where my mind is impacted to said the mongers was to fight a snake. Sometimes the snake next winner. 

Speaker 1  (17:43)
The mongole retreats has a little bit of herb income, perfect, so here and I hear other mangoes in the world is the snake. It will impact the value of unfavourable situation to our life. So if we can have the herb of peace and calmness format, taste, it surges an antidote to help us tide over the problems of the world and we are better equip to keep the mind income, so it's in our own interest directly guide. 

Speaker 1  (18:12)
Our eyes with wisdom, meditation, and the douse and bones And remain not trash, otherwise, we will be accepted eventually and mind being our enemy. This very mind leads us into depression into metal aslon and also comes next system, which you same so it guru says my mind is my limmie, but poses as my friend, so it goes to the extent of convincing to commit. Suicide, I will pose it in such a way and I'll realise that that's the best thing to do. 

Speaker 1  (18:49)
There's the only saviour I have on. So this mind we have to win some in some lifetime, otherwise it's going to land us a lot of troubles. So coming back again to square one that Very few hard to give this quality to take care of the environment and conservation. 

Speaker 1  (19:20)
Then that person's responsibility is to motivate others to get this going and it has to be a motivation. Some motivation will demanding some motivational be service 7 could be the rewards, we do not know, I recently met some gentlemen who gave a beautiful Ah, scan integral the people who are I think, is reading, alright.

So um, first of all, I really want to know that when we talk about the physical life, feeling too much heat or too much rains or the since ratification in any form, good or bad. Does the this really need are, or does this real have a connection with the adharta that we talk about or the supreme? 

Speaker 2  (00:45)
See, Ah at the human level, we are evolving, there's something called the law diminishing return, where we take the first most latest raigns test album. The 10th is less lucrative and then after some time it becomes tail, then you don't want to have more of it. So, similarly, the sales pages are like that, initially they may seem that they're giving me the satisfaction, but I see, but over your time I start getting disillusioned. 

Speaker 2  (01:21)
So there comes a time when we won't know where is real happiness in what lies happens, so then, the quest for real purpose supply begins. This happens after not seeking a searching, it is said that the there's this bird who sat on a ship than to sleep. In 3 day's, hence, the bird woke up inside looking for land when Northsouth east-west Kun finally then came back and sat a mission. 

Speaker 2  (01:59)
So here that bird is our mind looking for land is looking for happiness after we have searched and found and realised that the happiness is that I seek cannot be had from. Things or people, then the search turns inward, so the birdies are mine and the land is looking for happiness. Now we have evolved From all stages of life to becoming human, I will help you understand that you have whatever vapour, the God Guruji has proved through lots of physics, their law, physics says meticorner has been created, not destroyed a first office area. 

Speaker 2  (02:44)
The second law is the law of causing fact, which says if there is an effect there has to be caused for it if there is a book there has to be author if there is a painting the rest of the painter so the painting cannot be without the painters or the cause. And the book cannot be without the obvious cause. So this creation, as and effect that we see cannot be without the creator the cause there has to be a Cos 4 aspiration and guri says in this creation is a fluke, the flu could be something like a tornado going into a junkyard, and as it passes. 

Speaker 2  (03:16)
Through a going senfor 7 is created, is it possible? Your privacy laptop for a movement. I know some intelligent personal man, a dumb monitoring per school. 

Speaker 2  (03:27)
So when we see a human being bird, fruits and mill cheese, you know, some immense intelligence, the creation has made us so first and this whatever when this becomes water, the list becomes ice, so water vapour is gone without form. Water rice is manifesto creation that we seek, but waterlise purely heat becomes watermelon, so whatever what we see does not exist, actually in what water vapour is perm. So before this bottom ice is warm, it was all water vapour this water air passage of a creation segregated apartment view theately's creation. 

Speaker 2  (04:10)
So when he separated us from him, our journey as a mineral on the wind, which cannot move guys in this Spain, we bought from sand to play to iron, copper Brown silver gold impressions and like Rugby, sapphire and rural rhyme, we are the highest manifestation in the menu from here, the solar transform and the experiment foundation.
